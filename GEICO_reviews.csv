The pay is better than average, and profit sharing was awesome. (I should mention that my last year at GEICO was 2012. The drop-down only went back to 2014, so I selected it.)","There were metrics for everything. This resulted in the job being highly micro-managed. We were allowed less than 7 minutes to assist the customer. (They wanted your maximum handling time to be around 6 minutes and 40 seconds.) Management was not interested in truly offering customer service and resolving problems for customers., they just wanted to ""get them off the phone"". The reason for this was each regional office, known as a ""profit center"", would receive profit sharing based on how many calls that the center handled, so the director of the regional office, would be highly motivated to push for more calls per hour. I liked big profit sharing check myself, but I really believed that customers were not getting the service that they should. I was at GEICO over 10 years, and many of us who had been there that long would observe the floor the week before profit sharing came out, and joke about how many would be missing once the checks had been distributed, as few could handle the micro-management more than 2 or 3 years.",Former Employee ,"Lakeland, FL","It is complicated to try to offer advise to a company that has been so clearly successful as GEICO, and since it has been several years since I worked there, things may no longer be the same. Mainly, I would recommend that they keep the call monitoring process as simple as possible. It had been simplified about 2 years prior to me leaving GEICO, but by the time I left they had added so much to what was required on a call that it was more convoluted than ever, The flows for some of the calls took almost 4 minutes just to read them, and we were expected to execute the flow AND take care of the reason that the customer called too in less than 7 minutes. It made it difficult for those of us who were truly trying to help resolve the problem for the customer. (l recall that I would get 2 or 3 calls a day where the customer had called back because the previous counselor just wanted to get them off the phone, and few told me that when they called and got the same person again, they would hang up on them, as they knew that they had no interest in helping them.)",Lakeland, FL

6/30/18,2,Auto Damage Adjuster,"""Anxiety Inducing Chaos""","GEICO has yearly profit sharing, but the first chunk goes to an account that you only receive if you stay with the company 5 years. The second chunk is direct deposited.As an auto damage adjuster you get a company car that has gas, insurance, and maintenance covered, and unlimited personal mileage as long as you notify your supervisor of out of state trips. On the other hand, you pay ~$130/month for the ""privilege"" and it has GEICO advertising all over it, so you represent the company whenever you drive it.Decent pay raises when you have ""excellent"" performance. I've been at the company for two years, and am earning 28% more than I was as a trainee.You have some vacation days and floating holidays. Being sick consumes sick days, then vacation days if you run out of sick days. Having a serious health issue can cost you all of your time off, whether you were enjoying time in Tahiti or a hospital.There are clear goals that define your value to the company - See cons for a description.","It is nearly impossible to meet all the goals without gaming the system somehow (mostly by working unpaid or underpaid overtime). If you care about your emotional health, DO NOT WORK FOR GEICO. If you are able to compartmentalize completely and have no empathy or concern about your success or customers' well being, you might be fine emotionally. Half the adjusters I know have started taking Xanax or other anxiety meds since starting as auto damage adjusters for GEICO. I recently started taking Xanax due to the stress and anxiety overwhelming me almost daily.I receive an average of 20 emails a day, 5-15 phone calls per day, and have to write 5-7 estimates per day, including travel time, lunch, and breaks (I do not take breaks, and take as short a lunch as I can).On a day of severe accidents, just writing 5 estimates easily consumes your entire 7.75 hour workday (including travel time between locations). Even on those days you are expected to answer the phone 100% of the time (this is a survey question - you must ""always"" be available immediately for the customer, even if you are in an appointment with a customer face-to-face). Answering 20 emails a day about any claim you have EVER written (I've had customers bring up issues more than a year after repairs were completed) consumes an addition half hour to an hour, depending on how much you have to do. Making outbound follow-up calls to shops and customers consumes another hour.Basically, you are expected to do 10-11 hours worth of work every day, but do it within 7.75 hours. You can be constantly behind and work 8AM to 4:30PM, or you can work unpaid overtime and MAYBE stay on top of everything. Alternatively, you can put the extra two-three hours on your time card, get paid less than HALF your normal hourly wage (it's called ""PREMIUM"" time haha), decrease your productivity (the extra time counts as hours worked, even if you get paid less), and be criticized by supervisors and managers for putting it on your time card.METRICS/GOALS - HOW GEICO JUDGES THEIR ADJUSTERS AND DETERMINES RAISES/PROMOTIONS:Productivity measures how many estimates/claims you handle versus other adjusters. The general goal is to have at least 5 new inspections per day to meet the goal. If some of those 5 are supplements you do not get as much credit. If any of them are total losses you will invest hours settling the total loss for no increase in productivity. You are encouraged to skip lunch, take no breaks, and work unpaid overtime to increase this number. The most successful adjusters work unpaid overtime to pad this number, when in reality it can be very easy or impossible to meet the goal, depending on the severity of the accidents assigned to you.Customer service is basically someone who has no idea what your job is deciding whether they liked the way you did your job. Basically, a survey asks loaded questions to customers about their experience, and anything, even things beyond your control or the scope of your job, can sink you on the survey. The only acceptable response on the customer survey is ""excellent."" I have had customers decline to give an excellent rating because of GEICO policies that I cannot change, but my survey rating is still used to determine pay raises and advancement in the company. You are hounded CONSTANTLY if your customer service surveys drop below 80% excellent. The survey suggests that adjusters will ALWAYS be available, even though we have set work hours. This means customers get upset when you don't answer their calls on Sunday, Saturday, or at 4AM, they give you a bad survey, and there is literally nothing you can do about it except work unpaid overtime to answer crazy people's phone calls on your off hours. If a customer tries to get you to repair unrelated damage and you do your job and deny obviously unrelated damage (an example being ""Someone rear ended me, but my transmission started leaking, my brake pads wore down, and I got rock chips on the front of my car""), you may lose a survey for DOING YOUR JOB CORRECTLY.Severity is a measurement of the average cost of the repairs that you write. A properly written estimate can range within a thousand dollars just based on judgment and shops' willingness to negotiate, but an adjuster has NO CONTROL over which accidents are assigned to them - if you are unlucky and get lots of large accidents on expensive cars, your severity metric will be awful even if you write technically accurate/correct estimates. If you pay for things that are NOT RELATED to the claim, this can easily get out of control, but some adjusters do it to earn surveys.Reinspections - This measures the technical accuracy of your estimates, and SHOULD be the most important measurement of an estimator's worth to a company. GEICO reinspectors will go through your estimates and deduct points for anything they can possibly argue could have been cheaper or different. Depending on your supervisor and manager you may get leeway or not. In my experience reinspections have been fair, and I've only been marked down for legitimate mistakes I made.Rentals - You are judged by how long customers keep rental cars - if you get a lot of large accidents, you will have customers in rentals for longer. There is a formula that determines how many days are ""reasonable"" for a repair, but if the shop takes their sweet time on a repair (and they almost always do, they don't care how long a customer is in a rental car unless they're paying for it - and they won't even if it's their fault there are delays) you are faced with cutting off the customer's rental and getting a poor survey, or extending it for as long as it takes for their shop to finish the work. You actually have very little control over rental unless you are willing to sacrifice surveys and follow the formula to the day mercilessly.",Current Employee ,"Dallas, TX","Make up your minds about what matters most. Do you want accurate, well written estimates? Lots of estimates per day? Short rentals? Low cost of repairs? Happy customers?

You'll be required to be on the phones through out your entire shift (extremely heavy call volume) and not every customer who calls in will be happy-go-lucky. They're calling in because their insurance premium increased and keeps increasing due to a thousand different factors: *they've added a teen-age son/daughter along with their new car to their policy and their premium just skyrocketed thousands of dollars, *their premium increased because they got a traffic ticket or was in an accident, *premiums are increasing (period) because America is ""sue happy"" with spurious medical and personal injury claims and lawsuits...and there's tons of billing problems (etc.,). My point is these are the type of calls back to back. GEICO has one of thee toughest Call Center Metrics in the industry. You can't even make it out of training without hitting weekly goals and passing quizzes and tests. GEICO has 16 million policy holders so they expect you to finish a call in less than (6-7) minutes. GEICO training is very challenging and stressful. If you're OK with two managers coming to your desk, plugging in to your phone, grading and listening to your calls and watching how you navigate your computer -- GO AHEAD AND APPLY.

It's very hard. The pay is really low compared to competitors. My schedule changed to an awful schedule after I was told my schedule would NOT change.

Managers will disappear into meetings for 30 mins to an hour and won't even say anything. Then when you have issues, you're searching for a manager. They give you little freedom to do things on your own without the assistance of a manager. Information given to customers is very inconsistent....employees are usually on different pages. The vacation time is accrued. I've never worked for a company that heard such a stick attendance policy. I understand reporting to work as you're scheduled, but for those blue moon situations, geico has no regard for you. I exhausted my sick time and got extremely sick for approximately a week. I had no voice at all. I recieved a doctor's note and management appointment even review that. I even offered to come in and do other work off of the phones (there is other work that could be done) and they would not allow that. This was not a regular occurrence for me. I had not been sick in over 20 years! I ended up losing out on a weeks pay and it was unexcused. You're treated like a number here.

Some supervisors are focused too much on getting their bonuses and not on training. My training was shortened by days because my supervisor was in meetings for the last 5 days of our training and basically told us ""you'll just have to learn it on the floor""...and then threw us on the phones to figure it out. She did not have enough training herself to even help us with some problems and didn't have answers for some questions. Her focus was too much on getting her Bonus and time off because she was getting married. Telling employees that if they don't up-sell every customer that they will be forced to call that customer and apologize is absurd. Telling employees that if they don't use the correct emotion during a call that they will be forced to call back the customer and apologize is wrong and not how you train an employee to understand emotion and empathy. Focus less on metrics and more on training the employees. Geico claims that they promote from within, but this is only partly true. 2 of my 3 supervisors were outside hires direct to the supervisor positions they held. Neither had started from the bottom and worked their way up. 1 with barely more than a year with the company and 1 with less than a year with the company. The 3rd had been working for the company for less than 9 months as well, but was only a mentor and had zero emotional eq with the new hires and would say things like ""well what do you think?"" ""I don't know, what do you think you should do?"". Personally when I ask a question of a supervisor, I'm not asking because I know the answer, I'm asking because I need training and advice on how to handle the call. We were expected to keep our calls short (under 4 minutes), but then this mentor would basically tell us to figure it out ourselves. How is that training or mentoring? Show me where and how to find the info I need to quickly and efficiently handle the customers call and then we can talk about it later. When I spoke to a co-worker about this frustration our conversation was overheard and reported to management who then gave us a warning about not talking about managers. We were basically told that we weren't allowed to criticize our managers or we would be fired. I explained our frustration with the mentor in question and our supervisor literally did NOTHING to resolve our problems and in fact made it worse by letting the mentor know about the specific people who questioned her abilities. She then did as little as humanly possible to help those of us involved on a daily basis and would often be ""busy"" if we had questions and our other supervisors were involved with other trainees. Those of us involved quickly learned we should just not ask for her help and take the hit on our times to do the research ourselves or until one of the other supes was available. When training new hires, it should be the duty of a company to ensure that those training your new hires have enough experience themselves to ensure proper training. They kept touting the info that they hired 250 people and 17 new managers last year... but I fear that the people they are promoting and hiring to lead don't really know what they are doing and weren't trained enough themselves. Often my head supervisor wouldn't know the answer or where to even find the answer to questions customers asked. Training for the licensing was AWESOME and the trainer at Poway Geico is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She made sure we knew exactly what we needed to know and offered extra time for those that needed it. She is an asset for sure. The other month of training with our training supe we had was mostly a joke because HALF of our days were spent on the phones not learning anything and doing things like processing credit cards for customers - something that we were taught on day 1.

You'll have people you meet who will really like the job (they bleed for it, but truthfully a lot of them are miserable and have to maintain a ""brand""). I very strongly suggest that if you realize while you're in training that you don't like this job, that you make aggressive attempts to find another place to work, because it's only going to get worse for you. If you decide that you like this job, I suggest that you wait till you get to the desk to see if that thought still maintains. Over half of my class quit within the first 8 months. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't quit this job (and you hate it) w/o having another job, then you refer to my first piece of advice of applying for jobs aggressively when you first realize you hate it. Literally, as soon as you get even the slightest inkling that you don't like this job, start applying elsewhere. This job will drain you mentally, and begin to affect you physically. Prepare to be sedentary. Prepare to feel anxiety like you've never felt before. I still have boughts of anxiety from this job, and I left a while ago.

Prepare to feel like you wasted a lot of money going to school for you degree at this job. Prepare to feel belittled, ignored, like a nuisance, unsure, uncertain, irritated, and ready to consider unemployment as a viable answer to the problem that is this job. If you do end up realizing that this is your career than be prepared to bleed for GEICO. Be prepared to make GEICO your number one, two, and three priority, and then your family, mental and physical health, and kids your five, six, and seventh priority. Leave the fourth spot open just in case GEICO needs that spot too.

The program is also incredibly disorganized as well. When I went in on my start date they had no idea that i was starting that day! I had no badge, no packet, no ability to use a computer or anything else for that matter! When you are in this program you are supposed to be considered an important asset for the company, you think theyd make sure you can even get into the building! Also, for my first several weeks I had 0 instruction on what I was supposed to do! I had no management give me goals or work, or had any training available for me. Finally after I get into a training class room and access to use a computer (after several weeks) I went through my first rotation.This rotation was substantially longer than in needed to be and I failed to see why the time there was important. Everyone in this program has an undergrad degree and a high gpa, learning how to do basic functions and use simple software should not take several weeks.Ultimately, if you are looking for some quick and decent pay GEICO is a good company.

Not sure why they want someone overqualified for the job. The pay is lower than industry average and they know it and they’re okay with it. They give very unrealistic expectations for upward movement within the company, and of course the politics around actually being promoted. Favoritism over performance. Some of the supervisors are very incompetent. Micromanagement is heavy, sometimes you get told to do things you’ve already done simply because the supervisors are so ready to bark orders and pass down all the heat they get from the managers. Going to the body shops sucks if your territory isn’t the best. Common for body shop guys and even service advisors to buck up at you and exhibit rude and aggressive behavior if you don’t give them what they want. They also give an insane load of work to the adjusters that other companies do not, like settling total losses. (Such a pain) In order to get pay increases, you have to have a certain score, and some of the metrics are not always in your control. They grade based off of how much the estimates are written for, which is very unfair to the adjuster if they have a high end dealership in their territory (the estimates will always be higher because the parts cost more, more expensive labor, etc.) and it’s even more unfair to the customer because the stress of the adjuster trying to meet metrics affects the ability to keep the customers happy. Because of a lot of these things, turnover in this position is ridiculously high.

First of all, you will be grossly underpaid and expected to do a tremendous amount of work without a “thank you” or a “good job.” The office is understaffed because it makes the manager look better if they have less support staff working there, and gives the manager a better raise every year. The attorneys do not do any work, they just dump everything on their legal secretaries and expect it to be done right away. You will have piles of work on your desk, it’s not even worth taking a day off because you will just be overloaded when you come back. The attorneys think they are better than the secretaries just because they have law degrees. Attorneys can do whatever they want- they come in and out of the office as they please, work from home whenever they want, and they do not have to justify to anyone where they are. They pretend they are in Court for the entire day even if it clearly says otherwise on their calendars. Also, if you dare complain to upper management about anything, it will only get you in trouble and your boss will make your life a living hell. It will not help your situation at all. By the way, profit sharing is ok but you will only keep the money in your 401K if you stay with the company for 5+ years which no legal secretary wants to do. I guess this is their way of ensuring that you don’t leave the company. Another wonderful thing is that GEICO will not close the office for snow days. That means that if there is 19 inches of snow outside and you decide you can’t make it into work, they will take it from your vacation time.

The micro management was awful. I never had 3 managers watching my all movements ever. A ""coach"" who doesn't coach you, they sit on their phones and listen to you talk on the phone to say hey read the script again.

The reviews here are heavily diluted by sales and call center personnel, who aren't quite as spoiled and demanding as the IT posse. If I knew the things listed here I probably wouldn't accept the offer in the first place. I hope this will save someone some time and effort. I'm doing my best to stick to the facts.* There is a[t least one] PAID water cooler at GEICO. Yes, I'm being serious. Some people may stop reading the review here and I can't blame them. This will probably answer any questions you may have about snacks/coffee/soda etc. Tap water is free and abundant (at the time of this writing).* On a somewhat related note, GEICO - quote - doesn't provide headsets for laptops - unquote.* You have to clock-in and clock-out when you arrive and leave. I honestly haven't done this since working as a lifeguard while at school. There are turnstile gates and revolving doors. They may tell you that this is for security purposes only and they want to be sure everyone has left the building in case of an emergency, but your supervisor and HR do have access to your ins and outs and are not afraid to use it.* Although GEICO positions itself as a ""family friendly"" company, it offers zero maternity/paternity benefits. Also, it's the only employer in my career that is open on Friday after Thanksgiving.* GEICO is very proud of its ""Total rewards"" (tm, patent pending) benefits package. The truth is, it is average. You get three health plans (high deductible, low deductible and HMO/Kaiser), two FSA options, good dental plan, a number of life/travel/ADND coverage options, PTO and some minor stuff like employee discounts at various vendors. However, your benefits will not start on your first day. They won't even start on the 1st of next month or on day 30. GEICO apparently has some trust issues, so your benefits will kick in 70-86 days after your start (depending on your start date). Similarly, you start accruing PTO on your first day, but can't use it for six months. Nothing fancy and excessive you may see at other IT companies like ""unlimited PTO"", free food, stork money etc.* GEICO profit sharing plan deserves a separate bullet in this list. It's a replacement for both 401(k) match (which GEICO doesn't have) and bonus incentive. The way it works is: every year, based on overall company performance (and not your personal one) the management sets profit-sharing number at a certain percentage of everyone's annual salary. Associates are actually not allowed to disclose the exact number, cause this may upset some clients who got a rate increase and such. Well, let's assume that the last year this number was set to 17% (entirely fictional number I just came up with) and your salary is 100K. You get 10K (first 10%) to your retirement plan and 7K goes to you as cash payout (17-10=7%). It looks pretty good, however you should know that your 10% retirement contribution becomes fully vested after SIX YEARS of your service.* The pay is ok and not very generous as some people claim here. I got 5K bump compared to my previous job and my new one is 5K above that, which places GEICO in reasonable mid-market range.* There are ""designated cell phone areas"" around the building, contributing to the ""corporate prison"" atmosphere. The HR training specifically mentions that you are not allowed to take pictures on premises, and if you have an event you'd like to have documented, you have to invite a representative of a marketing team who is trained to ensure all sensitive information is removed prior to releasing photos. (Again, I'm dead serious. The HR training also specifically mentioned not to attempt to take a selfie with Warren Buffet should you encounter him on campus.)* A few more examples of signs posted to give you a better sense of GEICO's corporate culture: ""WARNING. Taking food NOT belonging to you is considered STEALING. Security will be monitoring the area."" Another one: ""The TONE ZONE is a CONTROLLED ACCESS AREA. Please keep the door closed at all times. Your privileges will be revoked if you are seen blocking the door open or allowing any unauthorized users to enter the TONE ZONE. Thank you"" (this is verbatim). I will leave it for you to interpret the language and connotations.* You should lock you laptops when you leave them in the building overnight using the Kensington-type locks provided. Although this is pretty common practice, I was told that here security officers enforce this policy by sneaking through the cubes and reporting violators (instead of doing their actual job - which is to prevent theft of said laptops), and you may be called to HR if you don't.* GEICO doesn't believe in telecommuting. There are about 7 employees who are working remotely on a regular basis (out of 38000). Occasionally it is allowed, but rarely.* You need approval to install anything on your computer. I requested permission for a popular free GIT client on 11/9 and the target date for the decision was set to mid-December. Same for anything else you can think of if it hasn't been previously approved. Yes, we have access to production databases with people's social security numbers, but can't install Greenshot.* I've seen some reviews mentioning ""cutting edge"" technology (there is also a very funny, obviously ""sponsored"" article comparing GEICO IT to Apple in terms of potential employment). Well, it's the end of 2017, and I was given a Windows 7 laptop, Office 2010 and MS Office Communicator 2007 R2 (no Slack, HipChat, MatterMost or anything of that sort). There's also a mainframe which is being actively used. You can decide how cutting edge this is.* Internet access is proxied and LOTS of websites are blocked. I mean, I would expect to have adult and file sharing sites blocked - this is standard. But this also applies to categories such as politics, travel (you actually have to check a checkbox confirming this is business-related) or simply a perfectly legit work-related website that has ""low web reputation score"". Why can't you just trust your employees at least a little bit? Download speeds will remind you of that 1.5Mbps DSL you had in 2005.* There is dress code. Basically, it's business casual and you will be given a PDF brochure listing what to wear and not to wear (not quite Apple, huh). Also, sometimes teams and individuals are allowed to wear jeans as a positive reinforcement for meeting performance goals, winning a competition, donating blood etc. This is the saddest incentive I've seen in my life.* I had to submit FOUR timekeeping reports - Workday time-sheet, MS Project time-sheet, VSTS user stories and daily email report to my supervisor. To be fair, you don't have to touch Workday if you worked full week without absences and daily email report is only required during first two months.* The building was built in 1960 and looks a lot like a hospital. This isn't a big deal, but those of you coming from trophy office spaces of Reston or A-class offices in downtown may be slightly disappointed. If you apply now, you may still see the old elevators with hand cranks, those are being replaced. Restroom stalls are about 2 x 2' and your work place will be slightly larger than that (they got rid of cubicles and now most of the building is open space rows of tables). You will often kick the person sitting on the opposite side of the row. He or she may reciprocate by kicking you. This fosters teamwork and collaboration.* There is dry law here. All events are strictly alcohol-free and you are repeated you can't have a glass of wine with your lunch (as if you are a college freshman with binge issues).

Benefits are great, and overall a good place to work.","Unfortunately, the cons outweigh the pros.Geico has unrealistic expectations for its claims adjusters. They have licensed adjusters taking first notice of loss as well as juggling setting up tows, issuing payments, following up on claims, and acting as call center agents for general claims inquiries. The tasks at hand are overwhelming and easily cause employees, espesically claims service reps to become stressed out. On top of this, reps are held accountable for things that are beyond their control. With so much growth going on within the company, it is difficult for good employees to promote. It is all about numbers. If you meet a certain number you promote, if not you stay put... regardless of the effort and skill, if you don’t hit the numbers, which some are beyond your control you will never advance. Also, in the Dallas office, the parking is ridiculous. The building is over staffed and there is not enough parking. Geico does not accommodate for this either. They want you to park at a bus station and shuttle to work and do not consider the time it takes to do so. They also give parking tickets and put boots on your car if you park in an unpermitted spot, even though they don’t have sufficient parking.",Current Employee ,"Richardson, TX","Get a bigger building and accommodate the parking issue for the Dallas office. This is a billion dollar company, we should not have to shuttle to work. Also, consider feedback from employees. Create focus groups to talk about protocol and policies and how they affect your employees. Establish a first notice of loss department like all other insurance companies and allow your licensed adjusters to focus on claim handling. Consider all aspects of skill and experience instead of just numbers to bring out potential in employees who desire to promote. Stop overloading work within one position and create departments for specific things. This would help with work/life balance and create a less stressful work environment. Also the system needs to be upgraded and revamped to be more user friendly. Consider allowing claims reps to work from home a few days a week to prevent parking issues and to assure adequate staffing during inclement weather. Create normal 8 hour shifts that start every half hour to help with call volume. LISTEN TO YOUR EMPLOYEES.",Richardson, TX

The moment I came back onto full time, they demoted me with no specific reason given. They put me under a supervisor who was not experienced and one night I got a call from an upset customer who had some issues with her rate. I went to a different supervisor to get permission to change her rate and was given the approval. Due to all of the medication I was on at the time, I forgot to document who I spoke to when I got the approval to drop their rate. Now, this call was recorded and at GEICO, you can see what is on my screen and hear me. The call recording makes it obvious that I went to get help on the call and got the permission but they were looking to get rid of me anyway so they ignored the evidence and fired me anyway. Not only did they fire me, but they denied my unemployment and when I fought it, the HR staff made up additional accusations that were not part of the termination. The irony of it all, I was fired on Veterans Day so that made it truly special.Still feeling betrayed and down from what happened with GEICO, I attempted suicide the following July.

For the first couple of years it's definitely more of a desk job. You'll be denying repairs, totaling cars, valuing cars, kicking people out of rentals, and basically delivering bad news all day every day. When you have to deny repairs or have to anger a customer in some other way in order to save the company money, customers give you bad surveys which affect your raise, no matter how ridiculous the reason for the bad survey.

The technology that GEICO uses is constantly failing, which either puts you way behind or keeps you from doing any work at all. You'll frequently need to stay late to get everything done because of technology trouble or if something unexpected happens like an angry customer yelling at you for an hour, but your supervisor gets to decide if you get time-and-a-half for that or ""Premium Pay,"" which is significantly less than your normal hourly pay. Most of the time adjusters don't claim overtime at all so that it doesn't negatively affect their productivity. People will try to intimidate, threaten, and harass you over company policies that you have no control over. You have to find time to document just about every little thing that happens throughout the day, you get random phone calls from the company to make sure you answer your phone, and if you get an ""internet inquiry"" from a customer you have to answer it within 40 minutes even if you have back-to-back appointments, and even if you get it 5 minutes before your day ends, and most of the inquiries require some digging into before you can respond, but of course you probably won't get paid overtime for that.

The higher you go, the less this becomes true. Advice: start by keeping your head down and working hard, and the more you grow with the company, work HARD on networking and building relationships.

They try to build office camaraderie through other ways (charitable giving, award ceremonies), but it largely depends on your supervisor (and your supervisor will change several times during your tenure).Expect process on process on process - if you can't keep up with emails letting you know something has changed or you can't roll with the punches, this may not be a good fit. Markdowns aren't always fair or applied judiciously.Sometimes processes are strange and there's no explanation. Or processes are strange and don't make sense until you move to the next ""level"" of claims because you didn't yet have the knowledge to understand the rationale.Recruiting is a bit disingenuous; for example, the MDP program is pitched as a fast-track to management. But management is really supervision and there are probably 90 supervisors in the building. Once at supervision, you then have to advance through 4 more levels of supervision to get to a manager role, yet the program was painted as a fast track to the top.

GEICO uses timecard systems to track the time even for IT employees. You would have to report to work on snow days regardless of the fact that the emergency state has been declared. Some managers allow remote work on snow days. In addition, everyone has to maintain high dependability score (97%), meaning that you can only take about 8 days off per year without giving an advance notice. It can be very stressful for the employees with young children.2. Remote work is not allowed. Only a handful of employee work remotely. Others can work remotely once in 2 weeks in certain departments. The prerequisites for being able to work remotely once in 2 weeks: owning a Windows PC and scoring over 97% on dependability. In the same vein, you won’t be able to access your email or IM from your phone. Your work PC is normally a desktop, not a laptop, which limits your productivity tremendously.3. Limited vacation and time off. With under 5 years of experience, everyone gets 2 weeks paid leave, plus 4 floating holidays in addition to 6 federal holidays. Other companies may offer either half day on before large holidays, such as Christmas Eve or Thanksgiving in addition to 10 federal holidays. Every 5 years of service grants you extra 5 days off.Overall, the leave is very strictly partitioned. For example, one can only use 12 hrs of sick leave a year. To use more than that, be ready to ask your doctor to fill out 6 pages of paperwork. Another example is that personal leave requires you to disclose the reason for it.4. A new open-floor set up does not allow for much privacy. The company is trying to streamline the workspace and make it more collaborative by placing more desks in a small space and lowering the cubicle borders.

You are micromanaged to the nth degree.I know so many people who are on prescription/street drugs and stressed out from working here. This job will eventually affect your health, sanity and personal life. It's one of the better paying jobs in the area, but at some point you have to ask yourself is the money worth it? Many people have left and taken pay cuts to be happier.Bathroom breaks are monitored worse than kindergarten, and if you use the bathroom ""too many"" times a day, it is assumed that you are just faking it just to get off the phone. The idea from management is that you are to use the bathroom 3 times a day. Once during your 30 minute lunch, again during your 15 minute break, and one more time after that.If you manage to stand working here longer than 1 year, make sure you get FMLA. This is the only way your sick time will not count against your dependability. Sure, you can call out sick if your kids are sick or you have the flu- but that'll count against your dependability and if you go below 97%...well then you will need another job. So make sure you get FML to use as a safety net to protect yourself. No one believes you even if you do have a legitimate health problem and anyone who does have FML is put on a not-so secret list by HR to be fired. You're made to feel guilty for taking time off even if it is approved in advance through the scheduling system. People who use their earned vacation are looked at like slackers.

You decide who is at fault in an accident based on drivers' recorded statements in which most of them usually lie and when your decision is made you will most likely be getting yelled at by both parties. Very fast paced work environment even for someone who is fresh out of training. Training does not actually prepare you for the job even though you are in there for about 2 months. A typical monday starts out with you getting to your desk and seeing that you received about 6-7 new claims over the weekend and are expected to contact every single person listed in the claim included the other person's insurance within 2 hours. Some claims can have about 5-6 different people that you will need to call and interview. If you don't complete this within 2 hours then when your claim is graded you will get ""downgraded."" Voicemails must be returned within 30 mins even though some phone calls last longer than that and you are required to log your voicemails so management can keep track of it. Call monitoring is what really put me over the edge. They expect you to apologize and be very courtesy to a customer who is threatening to your life, family, and cursing you out. If you don't say an ""empathetic"" statement .25 seconds after someone says for the 5th time in one phone call that the other person is at fault then you are downgraded. Micromanaged. Micromanaged. Micromanaged. Most employees are miserable. We were told we can't plug in our phone chargers into an empty outlet because it is company property. People leave crying pretty much every single day.

While other companies have a total loss department and associates that handle rental, you will be required to keep track of these things as well which quickly becomes overwhelming. On top of that, you are basically a one person call center, expected to take calls (monitored, recorded, and graded) while driving, writing claims, whatever you are doing and also document the claim file when you are finished. While insurance claims is never a happy business, GEICO exacerbates the issue with customers due to their cheapness making it very difficult to make customers happy and be compliant with GEICO's strict company policies. Even when GEICO is doing the right thing, you will still have to deal with fraud almost daily from both customers and repair facilities. Keep in mind also that customers will feel entitled to whatever they desire since they are either the insured who pay premiums every month or they're the claimant and are not at fault for the accident.In the end the stress was so great I started having panic attacks after work and on the weekends; at that point, I knew it was time for me to go.

You can fast track yourself into supervisor positions rather easily because they are always looking for that. Management is suportive and overall GEICO is a good company to work for. There are some downsides however!,"Here are some downsides in this particular position. The work/life balance is trash. With your set schedule it is almost expected of you to continue working until everything is completed for the day, or you'll get put behind on the next day when the claim load doesn't stop coming in. Often times you are put behind schedule due to other people's errors or the errors of a repair facility. You will not be paid overtime for this work. They will attempt to force you to work overtime on weekends with the bonus of actually being paid for it. My schedule is typically 8:30 to 5:00 Mon/Fri and I often times will not be finished until 6:30-7:00 through no fault of my own. They will say the claim volume is high and request you work weekends. Working without pay is the single most discouraging thing a company can do to you and for some odd reason it's legal. They do offer an overtime based on half your pay per hour but it will effect your metrics they grade you on which is a slap in the face. For this reason alone turnover is extremely high which causes employees to pick up more work because of staffing.",Current Employee ,"Richmond, VA",Maybe pay your people who work tirelessly during the week and then stop being surprised when they do not want to work your weekend shifts for you.,Richmond, VA

You get the schedule based off how you perform, so the better you do the more likely you are to get the schedule you want. Also, the pay and benefits were nice. They just implemented flexible breaks so you can choose what time you take breaks which helped on those days you break was scheduled really late. I enjoyed the Classes they offered during work and that they did try to keep the environment fun. We would have contests and games throughout the month.","The cons, they have a high emphasis on customer interaction but it's not reciprocated toward associates. I've seen people have panic attacks on the phone or get so angry with the way they have to take the disrespect from the customers that they bang on the desk, yell, or shut down. The supervisors would tell them to get back on the line with the customer and totally disregard the associate and their emotions. Once a coworker was very sick and they aren't allowed to tell you to go home, the supervisor said ""hopefully taking some calls will make you feel better."" There is an extreme problem with that mentality because it means the associate isn't not only being disregarded by the customer but also the company. Another con is they are always changing the way the calls are monitored so something that wasn't an error yesterday is an error today and there were many times my supervisor and other supervisors thought I didn't deserve getting errors but the monitoring people wouldn't overturn the decisions. Basically the calls you fail are based off who scores them, so it's more so luck than anything. Training is inconsistent so when you first come out of training you'll make a lot of errors and they don't care if you tell them that's how you were trained. The more failed calls the less likely you are to get promoted, it can prevent you from switching depts, and not allow you to take the courses.",Former Employee ,"Virginia Beach, VA","Making changes doesn't make the process easier.

GEICO is constantly changing, and not always for the good.You can start getting rated on your performance for procedures you never knew about. You'll be fixing the mistakes of other associates that they'll rarely be reprimanded for. Any performance reviews will be littered with the most trivial of mistakes (not even mistakes sometimes) that'll affect your rating as an associate. It's completely possible to absolutely do amazingly on a call, the customer is impressed, the file is clean, and all around it's moving towards closure. But the performance monitoring team (PMT) has such inconsistent ratings, you'll find you failed a call for something so tiny, it would have never affected the file. Your ratings for a call are pass/fail. Because of this, any mistake and you will fail a call no matter how hard you worked or how much time you put into it.The worst part of GEICO is the morale.The morale in this position is so low, you hear associates every day saying how much they hate it there and how eager they are to go home. People often talk about how they can't wait to quit. Most associates that have been in the department any time more than a year have become so jaded and apathetic that the files are a mess and can't even pretend to smile. Why bother trying if the smallest mistake will make you fail?The workload is insane. If you miss a day for any reason, you'll come back to more files than you can realistically work. Once you fall behind, you'll probably stay behind. The management will say you need to work your overdue files, but then send out 20 emails a day how you need to focus on phone calls. It's almost impossible to balance. I've seen employees come in with loads of motivation and enthusiasm only to fall into a husk of a worker sitting bitter at their desk.",Current Employee ,"Macon, GA",I am not a number.

(people will be sneaky and dial out really quick so they don't have to answer their own phone and management does NOTHING)You cannot ever call out unless you want your diary (the things you have to do in a day) to double or triple.You are expected to come in early and work late b/c how else are you going to get all of the work done? If you have children - this is NOT the job for you.Have a 97% dependability rule which if you even show up 5 minutes late your supervisor can count it against you.Kids get sick, dog gets out, family emergency? They are NOT sensitive to this. GEICO wants you to only be with them - ZERO work/life balance.When they find out an employee is starting something outside of work - they pressure you to give it up.People that have worked there for 15-30 years when I first started told me to get out now and I am SO glad I listened.You are expected to come in even in the snow. We worked when the blizzard hit this year - the office FINALLY closed at 2:30 after 6+ inches of snow had already fallen and that was the first time since the building had opened that it had closed. They will put you in a hotel and come and get you to take you to work but you have to work OT.Management will tell you it is an open door policy when it isn't - DO NOT BE FOOLED. They hold any and everything against you.If you work for GEICO it is basically like going back to high school - supervisors talking bad about one another and you can hear it, people in sections talking bad about one another or their supervisor.There is plenty of room for growth if you dedicate your life to GEICO and kiss up to the managers - they already know exactly who they are going to pick for a promotion before you even walk into the interview.(I know we weren't supposed to do this) but we compared our raises in the section and the men who have been there a shorter time got higher raises/pay then the ladies in the section who were more tenured and one of them (ladies) was ranked in the top 10 on the floor. Management tells you raises are numbers driven but every year the men made more money.Please please please, don't waste your time. You will be so unhappy - everyone there is so unhappy that you go into work and hear people complain all day.I switched to a different insurance companies and they looked at me like I was crazy when I asked them about certain procedures.

When you are first hired, they spend three days in ""GEICO 101"" trying to sell you on the company and how great it is and how lucky you are that you were hired. We refer to this as feeding you the ""GEICO koolaid"" At first, you believe it because you don't know any better. The pay is great, they train you for months and you have benefits. They talk up all the advancement opportunities and how easy it will be for every single one of us (typically 20 per training class) in the room to be in management. After you six or so months of training, they send you out in the world and to your supervisor where you meet your team. And this is where things get interesting... In training, you have roughly 4 coaches per class and then your trainer. You are supported and always have the help you need. On the floor with your supervisor, you have no support at all. You supervisor will have meetings throughout the day or will INTENTIONALLY hide from agents to prevent being asked questions or helping out people not on their team. Meeting ""hold time"" goals is almost unheard of because you cannot find support anywhere. Supervisors are not held to the same dependability requirements as agents and are never where they are supposed to be. This aside, the job itself is not the issue. I enjoyed my job and I was trained extremely well for it. The issues come in with management... If you get sick, kiss your job goodbye, my friend. They calculate something called dependability. This is a percentage the company decides how much time you can miss before being fired. As a business, I understand where this concept comes from and I do not fault them for it; however, their standards are completely unrealistic. Unless you are approved for time off in work force, it goes against you. It doesn't matter how much heads up you give or how much sick time you have, it hits your dependability. My co-worker got strep throat and was highly contagious and she was forced to come in and work her shift, exposing the hundreds of people in our office to her illness. Even if you have a doctor's note saying you are not allowed to return to work or you are contagious, you could be fired for time missed. After the first year of employment, you are eligible for FMLA if you have a chronic condition; however, they may not fire you for missed time, but you will be made to feel like it is an inconvenience to your manager or supervisor that you have such a condition. Sly, passive aggressive comments are a constant thing from management. People come to the job illness free and after working six months to a year there begin to development anxiety or heart problems. Almost every week, the ambulance is called for an employee in our building. And if you leave in an ambulance, fear for you job because it is an unexcused absence. Supervisors release FMLA related details to other agents which breaks so many laws. Management has little to no empathy for their employees. If there are ever any issues, it is your word against the supervisor. They look for reasons to fire people every February so they do not have to pay them a profit sharing check. It is the most unprofessional company and I would seriously reconsider before accepting a job here. Of my starting class in 2013, there is only one of us left at GEICO. Also, they advertise advancement opportunities; however, there are no open positions so you are trained to be a supervisor or manager and then are thrown back on the phones and are not thought of again.",Virginia Beach, VA

I talk a lot with being in a call center, so I drank a lot of water until a manager pulled me aside to tell me I was going to be fired if I kept taking personals. I was taking two a day-what I was supposed to be allowed. The customers often treat you like dirt, but!, unless they are cursing at you specifically, AND you have warned them, you're not allowed to disconnect. So, the guy that told me that he was going to hunt me down, kill me, kill my family, etc, I couldn't disconnect from because he didn't use curse words, per my manager while the guy was muted. They cause intense amounts of stress but offer no relief from it. You only get 7 days off a rolling year excuse or no excuse before you're fired, they list it differently saying that you have to maintain a 97% percent dependability to keep your job-I'm strictly talking about calling out sick, not vacation time. Despite the intensity of the day you get one fifteen minute break, and thirty minutes for lunch-though, in the GEICO 101 (welcome to geico class) they said 45 for lunch, and a break; you see what they did there, right? They, also, talk up their awesome benefits like disability, but when I was hospitalized, told I couldn't return to work, etc, they told me I would have to be out of work for 6 months before the benefits would start kicking in, I've been paying in for years but I get nothing, basically. The supervisors avoid calls from the phone reps making it just that much harder to do our jobs. The managers never listen to us when we try to tell them about that particular issue.

You will feel pulled in 10 directions at once.There is little to no communication between home office, regional mgmt, and associates.

It my years of adjusting, I have found that for some reason in this company's department, there is just something about the workers that are in this position. They breed a mentality of you as the adjuster are smarter and more understanding of how to fix cars than the actual body shops do. (With that being said, some body shops do try to take advantage of the situation, especially with the newer hires, but that's something you learn as you develop in the position) You go to training and fix a small tear and they expect that to be your bases of knowing how to effectively do your job for the remainder of your career at GEICO.Ultimately, the decision to leave the company came down to Management. Getting a degree taught me to learn and thinking freely and think outside the box. In this position, that is opening frowned upon. They pretty much want you to do what you're told and don't question. The term ""Below your paygrade"" is common thrown around by other adjusters.They pay wasn't the worst, but seems a little low especially after doing some interviews and ultimately accepting another company's offer. The big prizes and thank you's every year seem to be a luncheon, which usually has small portions.Company match 401k would be nice, but I dont see that happening. Profit sharing is pretty cool, but some people tend to be a little reckless when it comes to being giving that much money, they are smart enough to save some for you come tax time.The Training is too extensive and unnecessary and in my opinion a waste of the company's money. I remember when I went through training, they touted a ""3 month course"" designed to prepare you for the position. All I remember was cramming every night (which studies have shown that cramming is terrible for retention and is ultimately a not effective way to learn) fearing if you were to pass a quiz the next day or be yelled at by one of the instructors because they had very *sarcastic* styles. (note sarcasm is not suppose to be an excuse to be rude to your students). The three months of training was pretty useless considering the first thing you're pretty much advised once you actually start the job is to forget everything you learned and learn what your supervisor and body shop wants.

We are always short staffed in every office in metro NY and they refuse to hire experience adjusters from other companies. They hire people fresh out of college that have no idea about automotive insurance industry or even have a clue how to change the oil in their car. If they can pass the interview assessment test they hire you send you to training and maybe you can start inspecting damaged cars in 8-10 months once you get your license.

They cannot promote from with in because senior staff will does not want to apply for supervisor positions because of the longer hours and all the stress put on them. Supervisor are quitting for this reason also. Your job is to be customer service,rental rep. total loss rep and answer every single question for a customer. If you do not have the answer they now want you to find the answer and call customer back. All adjusters phone calls are recorded and graded and this will now be part of your core metrics for your raise. You are also graded on customer service surveys that are sent to customers which allows them to grade you fair poor good or excellent. If you are not graded excellent in a section you get a zero.

Let me elaborate on each. There are supervisors for every ten or so employees. They monitor all of your calls and grade you on everything from your tone and inflection to each word that come out of your mouth. You are put on a points system and after you've reached so many points, you lose the call. Lack of empathy, sounding unpleasant or leaving the member on an open hold longer than the allowed 20 seconds than automatically causes you to lose a call. After awhile it becomes ridiculous the things that can cause you to lose points.There is not an ""official"" script for you to follow; however, the supervisors insist on advising you of exact wording to use, which tends to sound scripted. Also, one of the biggest issues a lot of reps had with the company was the fact that bathroom breaks were considered personal time. You were given 6 minutes per day and if you went over the allotted time then it was taken from your vacation time.All I'm saying is that if you choose to work here, be prepared.

Offer months of paid training, paid vacation, sick leave and advertise as being a company that ""cares for their employees.""Do yourself a favor and truly consider a few things on this site before committing to employment to this company. Note that the average employee turn over is just over one year. This is a FORTUNE 500 company and people are coming and going like patrons at a fast food restaurant.When I first started at GEICO I was excited to be a part of such a huge company that was willing to pay for and provide my training so that I could become a licensed insurance agent. In the beginning the atmosphere was fun and high spirited but that changed quickly.In the service department you are graded on an unbelievably difficult scale that ranges from technical errors to perceived errors by a department that is responsible for ""grading"" your calls.Based on WHO is grading the call, you could be coached or fail. Believe me when I tell you that there is very little margin for error and agents are routinely threatened with termination of employment.They sell you at the door with all of the perks, one of which is paid vacation and sick leave but fail to inform you that if your are sick (even WITH a physicians note) that calling out regardless of advanced notice with result in a hit to your dependability (which can not drop below 97% or again you will be threatened with termination of employment. Also, if you know that you are currently sick, go to work ill and request to use paid vacation for the next day or two as to not adversely effect your dependability, you will be swiftly told that you can not ""Plan sick leave"" and that request will be declined.During your employment you will be drafted to work the paid holidays that they promise-you do get paid overtime but only if you work over 40 hours and because the standard work week is 37.75 it's never much of a bonus.Also, don't fall for the ""advancement opportunities"" ploy. You can only advance to supervisory/management position with completion of a bachelors program...and all that talk about GEICO footing the bill for your tuition? Only if you want to take a loan out through their employee credit union AND pay interest! Or you can pay it all upfront and they offer reimbursement (up to 5k-taxed).GEICO has the corporate game down to a science. Any way they can come up with to make sure they come out on top, they will do it.. They even make you sign an agreement upon hire that forfeits any accrued paid time off if you resign or are terminated, which for the longest time I thought was against the law but they managed to find a way around that as well!GEICO is hands down the most scheming, underhanded company I have ever worked for.

This low availability plus a high turnover rate means you will frequently be taking back-to-back calls which leaves no recovery time after getting yelled at by a customer. Geico's biggest problem is they are always understaffed they grew very quickly to 13 million policyholders but because of their high turnover they are constantly hiring to make up for this. This problem seems to be getting worse with no end in sight. Granted mgmt has been hiring lots of service agents-many of whom seem to have huge knowledge gaps due to being rushed onto phones because of the low service levels- it really seems like for every agent we gain we lose two if not more...HR/ Leave policies are draconian. Because of heavy workload due to low service levels I, a healthy 27-year-old, got a bad case of carpal tunnel so I applied for FML. To do so I obtained a legitimate doctors note with specific instructions where he indicated my workload should be lessened to allow enough recovery time. Well long story short these instructions were never accommodated and when I brought it up mgmt/ supervisor had the gall to say, ""well that's not what the dr.s note said."" Are you kidding me? They basically were implying I was stupid and couldn't read. Also, no surprise FML was declined after two Dr.s visits and several phone calls to re-fax paperwork.As far as leave be prepared to accrue very little vacation hours relative to how hard you work and pray to God it gets approved when you need it. You will very frequently have to work holidays, weekends and nights due to aforementioned service levels. Also you can basically only miss 5 work days per year anything more will put you under the standard 97% dependability. This policy is so draconian given you work in tiny cubicles, we work in a high stress environment and are sitting all day which means this is really unhealthy and weakens our immune system. Also, almost every reward mgmt gives is very high fat/ sugar which only weakens immune response even more. This gave me the distinct impression that they don't care about your health. I'll grant that HR recently started offering discounts on fit bits and other weight loss programs but it's scary to think how many people there fall on the obese/ morbidly obese category or smoke and how this high stress environment puts them at risk of cardiac events/ strokes. I honestly have seem ambulances called to work multiple times there in my 4 years there and this is not exaggerating nor hyperbole this is fact. Also, for those of you with families there is no paid maternity leave and this job is very much not family friendly in terms of working with your schedule. It wasn't until I told mgmt that I was quitting that they even considered accommodating my schedule.Pay is less compared to other insurers, commissions might be better for sales but still wages are still low relative to other employers in the industry.For any serious applicants weigh the cons and pros and I'm sure you'll find it's really not worth it unless you have no other choice.",Former Employee ,"Tucson, AZ","You guys seriously have your work cut out for you. From my experience MGMT is not one to change status quo but there seriously needs to be a huge overhaul as far as being more family friendly or better pay or both. Since this company is set on being a 24/7 service provider though it's not likely this will happen.I can respect that they have to answer to their superiors and being available for customers is very important but they are so caught up w/ underwriting correctly, performance and following protocol that there's a huge disconnect w/ customers and employees. It really gives the impression to both associates and the customers that you're just a number or policy numbers and all you care about is the bottom line. I'm of the opinion that this is actually the case especially given the fact that Berkshire Hathaway, who owns Geico, practically has the mobile home loan industry all but cornered and participates in what many would call dishonest and predatory lending practices. It's ironic because Geico touts their 7 operating principles, one of which is to ""operate with uncompromising integrity.""",Tucson, AZ

(work=double, pay=half compared to other insurance companies of their caliber) This is why in my opinion they are the ""low-cost provider"".The work-life balance, the dependability standards are kind of insane. Your dependability is measured by the minutes you are late, take off,sick, leave early, etc. Anything you do leads back to your dependability score, and it gets a little outrageous, if you ask me. I mean i understand that being on time is important and I pride myself on being on time as well, but emergencies do happen and i just didnt agree with that score being affected in all circumstances, and it is. Also, the vacation time, you don't earn your vacation until 6months in and at that point you are lucky if they let you use it. Requesting off was like pulling teeth. I had friends that requested a day of a month ahead of time and was immediately told ""NO, and there is nothing we can do, you should find someone to shift swap w/you"". Huh? A month in advance?

9/30/15,1,Sales Representative IV,"""You will be stressed and it will affect your quality of life""",profit sharing. if you know the right people you can advance.,"Employees are overworked, mistreated and disposable!Overworked: Ideally most people want to work Mon–Fri with weekends off right? You will have to work weekends (either a Saturday or a Sunday, sometimes both). Whether you’ll work every, every other or 1 out of every 3 weekends will vary, but no one’s immune to working weekends. Currently GEICO’s Macon office forces employees to work 10 HOUR SHIFTS on the weekend (Sales department). When you work a Saturday or Sunday, you get a weekday off (8 hrs) the following week. As for the additional two hours, they break it up; you leave 30 minutes earlier for the rest of the week. How’s that fair? I’m forced work for 10 consecutive hours in one day, but you give me the additional time off in small increments? Not to mention you will rarely get two consecutive days off. If you’re forced to work on a Saturday, & off on Sunday, your 2nd day off will be: Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday (never a Monday or Friday).Abused: GEICO has also tricked employees into working overtime. They claimed that overtime became MANDATORY, & that every employee would have to work a minimum of 2 additional hours per week. They would start by sending emails that would say please sign up for the mandatory over time, if you didn’t volunteer, a supervisor would come to your cubicle and force you to sign up. The number started increasing to a minimum of 5 hours per week. This went on for approximately 4 to 6 months before some employees complained to HR; we later found out that what they were doing was NOT LEGAL.Mistreated: First time I made GEICO’s Chairman’s club (My results for the year were in the top 10-15%). Every year the CEO visits, & gives an award to each associate that made Chairman's. The ceremony usually lasts a couple hours, and it’s supposed to increase employee morale by giving recognition. The particular date of the ceremony happened to also be my day off (from working the previous weekend). I asked MGMT, if they could switch which day I was off, so that I could attend. I was immediately told No, & if I wanted to attend that I would have to go on my own time. Yet, any employees regularly scheduled to work that day, were still being PAID while attending the ceremony. MGMT was also fully aware that I commuted over 60 miles one way to work, when they told me no. Hearing that was like throwing dirt in my face, I literally could not believe it. Why do you think treating employee's so badly, will motivate them to perform well for your company?Disposable: The goals are ridiculous & every year they increase, to the point where they’re not even close to being attainable. Employees have approximately 5-7 goals, & each are worth a percentage to give you an overall score between 1 and 5 (1 being the worst, 5 being the best). Being in sales, I had a Sale per hour goal, & I had to confront my supervisor about receiving conflicting results/scores. For Ex: Month 1: I sale 200 policies, & my score would be a 2(below average). Month 2: I only sale 160 policies, yet my score would be 3 (average). No one could explain to me how the result was actually calculated, so how exactly am I expected to improve? If you score at least a 3 on all of your goals for at least 3 months (consecutively), you are eligible for a raise, and a pay grade/scale increase. Yet they won't mention up front that your goals will get harder as your pay grade/scale increases. Once your results/scores start to slip below average (anything below 3) you will get put on a probation period. If your results haven’t improved by the end of probation, they may offer to move you to another department or FIRE you. Yes I did say fire; GEICO likes to state how they NEVER lay off employees. Well this is how they do it folks, they will make your goals unreachable, and if you don't quit from the stress, you can and will be fired. By doing it this way, they don't have to publish in the papers that they had to lay off. I've heard this straight from the horse’s mouth, as well as witnessed this happen to many colleagues.",Former Employee ,"Macon, GA","Stop treating employee's like dirt, we are people not robots.

Some offices have a fun and supportive environment that can made it easy to look forward to coming in to work every day.The company as a whole was great to work for but their growing need for mid-level management has resulted in huge gaps in basic industry knowledge as results are valued more than skill and expertise. Consequently, this might be a great place for you if you want to promote quickly and don't mind putting up with a lot of stress and anxiety.Honestly, I never considered working for another company until the con list below became too much.","GEICO's growth has far outstripped their ability to attract enough talent to manage the workload. This is well known, but the pay they offer is nowhere near competitive enough for the industry especially when it comes to the workload they expect you to manage on a daily basis.Combine low pay with salaried positions (no overtime) and an average of 3 to 4 hours of work after your shift ends every day and things are not looking good for GEICO in the long-term if they cannot turn this trend around. Eventually, they will only be left with employees who don't have better job prospects elsewhere due to poor performance and those employees who are top performers and easily move into middle management.

They had always provided good health care benefits prior to this. Keep in mind that 95% of increased wealth in this country goes to the richest 1%. We can’t be messing with that.Yes, the healthcare is probably better than what you’ll get at a low-paying job. Just know that if you need a procedure (not talking open-heart surgery here) you’ll pay $1500 or more. MANY tests and procedures will require you to pay 10%. Don’t forget that having one procedure may also require tests, Xrays, MRI or CT scan before and after. You'll pay 10% for all of them. Also, some of the co-pays are really high. Depending on your plan and your family situation, your out-of-pocket costs could be many thousands of dollars if you have a significant health concern.Google Kaiser Family Foundation and their employer survey of healthcare costs. What you will get at GEICO is not competitive. Don’t let anyone with an agenda tell you differently.I used to think the GEICO management would do what’s decent for their employees.

As a result, they are out of touch with the latest and greatest technologies as well as modern management practices. Agile has been introduced at Geico, but management has no idea what to do with it. Open source technologies are used in parts of Geico, but have not been embraced by the company as a whole. A lot of my co-workers were just binding their time until retirement. They were also woefully ignorant of any current technologies. Unfortunately that ignorance extends to leads and managers as well.   On a personal note, a lot of people at Geico are miserable. I remember walking through the halls everyday and seeing all the old and miserable faces. I worked in groups where people complained every single day and slept at work. The cost of living and traffic in DC make it a hard place to live, especially if you don't know how to manage your money which a lot of workers their don't. A lot of workers there are dead weight with ancient skills. Geico does them a favor by not getting rid of them.. Instead of trying to gain new skills, they just stay there and coast until retirement or complain because they have no place else to go. I am not sure how long this will last, as Geico already has numerous off shore teams. At some point, Geico is going to have to get rid of all the people who have been there for years and years, yet refuse to update their skills.  If you are under 30, and don't have a family, I would not suggest working there. I am currently working at a more modern company. I get free lunches, free breakfast on Monday, a cell phone and a mac laptop. They let you telecommute. The offices are gorgeous. I don't care how many emerging leadership programs Geico has, there is no way young people are going to stay at a company that offers 0 to no perks. Not when the headquarters is run down and drabby and you have to badge in and out of the office like a robot. Young people don't care as much about financial security and aren't buying houses and cars at the same rate. Other companies have big bonuses as well. Geico might be more stable, but if you have the right tech skills, you can always find a job. Unfortunately, you won't get these skills at Geico.",Current Employee ,"Chevy Chase, MD","I am not sure what to say. My criticism is pointed at technology, but Geico is an insurance company and extremely profitable by being the low cost provider.

Just like their commercials this is marketing at its best, and a trap for anyone willing to believe it. No one work should work this hard for $41k with a college degree.Red Flag #1: Rumor is that one employee killed themself from the stress associated with the jobRed Flag #2: People feel obligated and required to work until late at night and on the weekend to ""catch up"" or so their monday will be manageableRed Flag #3: Why does everyone always have a head set on? Do they actually talk to people they sit next to? The answer is not really, unless you want to use that time later tonight or saturday to catch upRed Flag #4: If everyone makes $60k in two years, why does no have anything nice, and skip lunch so they have enough money to pay their bills?Red Flag #5: You have to pay for the crappy office coffee most people take for granted. Why? Because GEICO is a low cost provider and doesn't want to pay for coffee which might actually increase productivity. If you look at the average cost from an overhead standpoint, they probably spend more from people being pissed off about it and do nothing for 5 minutes when they realize they have to pay for black coffee.Basically as an MDP you perform the job of CSR 1 where you make liability decisions and help determine coverages. They give you more work than you can handle, knowing a majority of people work 9-12 hours and come in the weekends, but don't offer any overtime.When asked why is the work load so large, they reply back that there is an unforeseen increase in the amount of claims and that help is on the way. These are lies, and they just work people until they quit or learn to deal with this crappy job. My question is if they acknowledge a large increase in claims and know people will have to work extended hours, why not offer them overtime? When you know people are working 50-60 hours a week regularly, why does not one get overtime, a bonus, or some incentive?GEICO offers low insurance rates and is a low cost provider. This translate to employees receiving crappy compensation, unreasonable work loads, and not being offered any perks that most people enjoy in a job.Everything you do is measured from accountability, how quickly you return phone calls, and a numerical score of your overall rating compared to your peers.Turnover is close to 20%, which means people hate their job.

2/26/15,1,Claims Service Representative,"""A Big Migraine!""",1. Half-way decent pay.2. Benefits.3. Have a job.,"There are many cons working here and please be advised I was an above average employee. I even got their highest annual award for customer service, the Chairman's Club Award.1. Poor management skills. I will start off and say that I had a couple of wonderful supervisors when I worked there and am not including them in this group. In the 3 years that I worked at GEICO I had approximately 14 supervisors on the CSR floor. After 10 you quit counting. Many of the supervisors are emotionally and verbally abusive. It's like they believe the meaner they are the more results they get. Yeah the results they get are high turn-over rates. One even yelled at an employee on the floor in front of everyone and brought up medical issues of the employee, hello HIPPA laws anyone. That supervisor got a slap on the wrist because she was married to someone in management. They all tell you a different way of doing things, and I mean way different from each other. Many of the supervisors are up talking to each other instead of being with their team and answering questions or helping. Some that are sitting at their desks will not answer their phones to answer a question. It's like hello we can see you. The supervisors play favorites horribly so. They nit-pick over the stupidest things and it seems they do so they have something to complain about. Many of the supervisors are narcissistic, and are on some crazed power trips. If you try to give a supervisor an opinion on how to do something better or more efficient then they start treating you like you are a danger to the organization. They seem to like the employees that do the bare minimum of the job and demand more and more of employees that work hard.2. Feel like you are back in high school, or even junior high. There is a lot of gossiping and back-stabbing, which sadly is mostly among the supervisors. You are also treated as if you do not have a brain to think for yourself. If you do think for yourself then you will make problems for yourself and probably be out the door as soon as they can manage it.3. HR department and FMLA and dependability. If you are out for less than 3 days then there is no FMLA and it counts against your dependability. So those workers that go back to work sick so they don't miss too much work will have it counted against them. If you are out more than 3 days then you can apply for FMLA. However, HR gives you to paperwork to take to the doctor. Doctor fills it out exactly like it says on paperwork and faxes in to HR department. HR turns around and says the doctor needed to write something else in or word it differently. You take it back to doctor, doctor is aggravated by this but does work and sends it in. Oops he sent it in a day late so it doesn't go under FMLA and your dependability goes down. See GEICO gives you sick leave but if you do not give 24 hour notice then it counts against you. Yeah like I know I'm going to have the flu in 24 hours from now. Give me a break.4. Old buildings. The buildings are very old. The elevators shut down for no reason all of the time, sadly with people in it. I got stuck for 45 minutes one day. The bathrooms overflow all the time. I saw mold in the ceiling in some areas which is a health hazard. The fax machine and printer break down all the time.5. Meetings that accomplish nothing. Management harps on you to work your claims and be on the phone so many minutes everyday but take you out at least once a week for a stupid meeting. These meetings accomplish nothing except you are not working your diary or taking calls or calling back someone you said you would. Management is big on saying they are going to take care of problems such as employees cheating the system to make their numbers better and have meetings about this but they never do anything.6. CSS or customer satisfaction surveys. You need to look at those surveys carefully and when it is a bad rated survey only punish the person that there is a complaint about, not everyone involved. If the CSR dropped the ball then don't mark the AD adjusters numbers down and vice versa. You are losing good employees because of mark downs like that when CSR and AD adjusters cannot control each other. Also, you need to look at your ARX body shops better. Some really suck, multiple customers complain, and yet you want CSR to sell that body shop. That is called lying.",Former Employee ,,1.

Most of the bad reviews I see on this site for this company are related to the call center cubicle jobs that can be inherently mundane and can have a high turn over rate.- Best-in-industry training set me up to hit the road running. I felt very comfortable coming out of training in an industry I've never worked in before. Body shops have also told me GEICO adjusters are noticeably more knowledgable coming out of training than other insurance company's adjusters.- Great pay and raises. Pay during training was good and the added overtime offered (which only better prepared me for the real job) made the total pay during training to be fantastic. The company rewards adjusters who do their job as expected. Within the first 12 months after training, the annual salary increased by almost $10k.- Benefits for myself and my family have been great. Medical/Dental/Vision coverage is offered. When my wife gave birth to our child, we only paid around $300 out of pocket for the hospital stay and everything else involved in the birth (ie charges for drugs and lab stuff).- It is not a desk job. It is refreshing not being stuck in a cubicle all day. I do have a work laptop I have to sit down with and write up estimates, respond to emails and work on other admin tasks, but much of the job is out and about in the body shops, face-to-face with customers, inspecting vehicles at tow yards or driving from place to place.- Work is not boring. The work day/week flies by and no two days are exactly the same.- A lot of room for growth within the company. GEICO is a large company and is still growing rapidly. This means a lot of opportunities to grow and promote within the company and there are always openings, in many different areas, all over the country.","- Auto Damage Adjuster training is rigorous. 12 weeks of training, with 4 weeks in Washington DC, was definitely a sacrifice for me and my family.

You can ask 5 floor supervisors & associates the same question and get 5 different answers on any given day. Some processes & criteria make no rational sense and aren't value-adding at all. You have to be able to slog through all that stuff and perform well despite it. I've also noticed that having a good supervisor and being on a high performing team is hit or miss and that stinks because it can affect your performance a lot, especially when you're new.

Paid training if you can survive that mess. Accumulating time off is quick. There is available overtime although in my region, you will not get paid a full hour for overtime you work. See cons.","They say you are an hourly employee but you will be paid 7.75 hours a day even if you work 12 hours. Your dollars per hour erodes very quickly with that approach. And you will be required to do far more than anyone can get done in 7.75 hours a day, trust me! Every aspect of your job is measured and graded. Flawed customer surveys where even an 8 out of a best score of 10 is failing are a big thorn in a lot of adjusters' sides. A customer can screw you for missing a phone phone call, no joke! You will be over worked. What you are expected to do is not practical. No other company that I know of requires a single person to run so many aspects of the claims process as this one does. You must make a minimum of 3 calls throughout a claim to every customer you get. Take care of their rental, their payments to the shops, supplements, the entire total loss from evaluation to collecting the title- when that is the case, and answer the phone every time it rings. Now 3 calls per customer may not seem like a lot, but you will have between 8 and 10 customers a day. Do the math and that is 24 to 30 outgoing calls a day in addition to getting your work done. An average call is 3 minutes. When you're writing the estimates, you will be required to find the best price for parts available. That means making several calls to suppliers while standing at the vehicle. No big deal, right? Do that in the rain, the snow, when it is polar vortexing, or in the dog days of summer and you will grow tired of it. You are required to document everything as well. Just about every contact with the customer has to be described on the computer. Talk for 3 minutes, then go online to the Geico website, wait for the claim to load, and type in what you talked about. That alone can take up a day. And the rental companies are constantly calling for rental extensions! But-Before extending a customer's rental, you must find out why their car is not done in the ""reasonable time"" you are required to set by Geico. Nothing you do will be quick and easy. And it builds up any builds up and builds up until you consider taking vacation days just to get caught up. Another measurement is productivity. You could literally spend 8 hours with customers settling total losses on an unpaid Saturday because doing it during the week would cut into the time you have to write the total loss estimates . And if you don't write 4 or 5 total loss a day while doing your total loss rotation, you are simply unproductive according to the measurement formulas Geico uses. That doesn't seem too much to ask though? Well it is because you need to arrange towing, get cars out of impound, and call internal investigators when claims appear fishy all while keeping your customers informed. You have to set the last day for customer's rentals, take care of salvage, and refer customers to a car buying service. And make no mistake, customers are rarely happy with the value of their cars so when you call them with the news, you are in for a long conversation that is not going to go smoothly! So now to overtime. Being paid time and a half sounds great! It is around $33 per hour. But the time and a half hours are weighed as time and a half in your productivity score so you will be ""encouraged"" to work 8 hours of overtime but put in for only 5 or 6. And people do it because the only way to get raises is by having a high enough score on all the things you're graded on. Lastly, realize that at least half of your customers will be angry or mistrusting. They say things like ""Your customer hit me! Why should I have to be forced to allow a used part on my car?"" You are the enemy and they believe you are trying to screw them over some how. It is a constant battle to be pleasant to them as they argue with you over after market parts or why your estimate is far lower than the shop's. So you will have to defend your estimate and try to win them over. It is exhausting! Then the shops the customers go to do the same on a supplement. Your supervisor will pick apart your estimates and ding you for the numbers of hours you put for repairs or any mistake they feel you may have made. That is called a reinspection. They have to do those because that is something they get measured on. So on one reinspection, your supervision may put excessive refinish time because you wrote to blend an adjacent panel that in his/her opinion did not need it. Then a week later, they write that you should have blended. You will write to replace a door, they will say it could have been repaired. But you know the shop the customer is going to would never agree to a repair so to avoid a supplement, you wrote replace. By the way, number of supplements are also a measurable metric. Oh for the love of all that is sacred, pass on this job!",Current Employee ,,Hire more staff. Stop asking for miracles from your employees. The customer is number one right?

People that will have the advantage will be the ones that know something about cars which it will make it much easier for them to get through the course.You’re going to need to learn over 200 different car parts by name and spelling, this is very important since when they grade your papers for each exam every day they will mark it wrong if you forget a ""s"" or anything it has to be exactly has the book. So do by entering the word but forgetting a letter proves that you know the answer, but you might not be the best speller GEICO doesn't care they want exactly has the book wrote it.Every exam is going to be the same way you’re going to get diagrams which will be about 70% of each exam and then question which will be the remaining question of the exam. Spend the most time studying the diagrams every night until you get them all memories completely word for word.Then spend the rest of the time reading the chapters that you reviewed every day look for the odd things in the book and memories those things also. Since the question will have about 10% of them are trick question and a lot of people get those wrong on each exam.There will be a portion on definitions you there going to tell you that you need to learn word for word. You don't make sure that you know exactly all the words there is going to be another 100 words in this list that you need to learn. The best thing is to be able to associate the words with the definition, don't waste your time on trying to learn all the definitions by heart for the few that are going to be ask that way it’s not worth it to waste all that study time on those.The diagram exam is the easier of them all since you will already have learned them by heart throughout the first 2 weeks. So that one you won't need to study that much just mostly review them and move on.The estimate exam well that one that is not very fair. Let me explain the simple reason is that it's graded base on other student and not actual damage to the vehicle. So let's say student X writes down 10 lines of damage on the vehicle and you write 8 lines, you’re going to lose points because you don't have the same amount has him.The issue is that it’s not realistic and there is no standard to be gauge by except another student. So if a student says on car X ""well I think that this damage was caused by the scenario"" and the teacher says ok. Then you’re going to lose points if you didn't write it down, again unrealistic since that damage had nothing to do with the original damage at all it’s just another student opinion.This is one is very unrealistic and I didn't really get the point for the simple reason that your trying to train somebody in finding exact damage on a vehicle. In this case is how much imagination do you have and nothing of exact damage this was a really huge waste of time. Not good for the training purpose at all, you’re trying to have people learn how to do car estimate but then you have them prove why they thing that damage should be on an estimate. That would be like taking an exam in college and then saying well this answer should be good because in this situation. So you can see that this exercise has no training value at all and is a complete waste of time. So don't worry this one is more of a luck exercise than anything else and I would recommend to just be friendly with the other student and try to get an agreement and everybody write the same thing and then the grades are higher.The initial portion of the training needs to be change, student should be learning the parts in the book but spelling mistake should not be counted unless for the simple reason that if you wrote septamber and that is the correct answer the teacher know that you know what the answer is but this would not count because it’s not spelled correctly September. This is a waste of time since the student is going to be using a computer with spelling correction. Don't you want somebody that know the material then somebody that can spell that's my question?Should also try to invest in some kind of 3D software do your ""low cost provider"" this would greatly increase student that have no mechanical background. I would also base my recruiting focus more on people that have some kind of background in cars; this will increase productiveness in the long wrong once the student gets into the field and start estimating damage. Since being the low cost provider the company should know that the learning curve is going to be a complete memory dump after the training. For the simple reason that you are pushing so much information to each student that he will need to relearn most of everything. This is already apparent just by the lower test scores on Monday.",Current Employee ,"Houston, TX","Change the training not because it's been done in this fashion for the past 20 years that it's efficient.

We sit for 3 to 4 hours each day before we take our first live call. Upper level management has admitted that keeping leads in the pipeline is a problem and will be for a while. They have told us that there will be little to no leads until start of 2014 or early spring. What this means is you are forced to survive on salary similar to retail and no opportunity for bonus. BUT WAIT!! They have already started to talk about top sellers who have only taken 3 calls a day and got lucky with closing 2 of the 3. The metrics talk has started and they cannot produce leads to accurately measure performance. They do a good job of hiring people with no real world experience and with no clue of what a good outside sales opportunity can offer with top performance. BOTTOM LINE!! This is a call center with no calls to take. Producing 400 jobs by the end of 2013 will be meaningless for Indianapolis when people start dropping like flies because they cannot afford to pay the rent.

( Field Adjuster)""","Good pay, stable company, profit sharing","To start with when I began this job I honestly thought I was the luckiest guy in the world, I loved it was even messed with by my coworkers for ""drinking the kook-aid"". I bought coloring books and GEICO swag out of my own pocket to give out since you can't stop anywhere in the company car without someone asking for it. I have been employed 8 years and have never imagined a company changing like I have witnessed GEICO change. The company has lost record numbers of associates and cares only about growth at any cost. If you become a field adjuster just forget you have a private life as there is no time for that. I was recently included in a focus group the company put together since the recent associate opinion survey numbers wee horrible. Out of the 25+ adjusters on the call no one said a word when the moderator asked for someone to give a positive about working for GEICO but when she asked for negatives it was amazing, everyone spoke at once and didn't stop. Most everyone admitted they were job hunting. Every move you make is critiqued by numerous people most of which know very little about real world claims they simply have read a book and moved up and GEICO has a way of making managers and supervisors feel like they are God, fact is this company exploded in growth so fast that a pulse was all that was required to become a supervisor or manager as they just didn't have enough people. The task and responsibilities have increased tremendously the past year alone but the core metrics and productivity has not been adjuster at all. A seasoned adjuster has $15,000.00 draft authority which means they can write a check for $15,000.00 without having it approved by anyone but supervisors will actually tell you they may check your phone records to verify you have made the calls your supposed to!! I never knew it was possible to be this miserable with a career and it makes no difference who I speak to during the day or what dept. there in they are miserable and looking for a way out.

Even supervisors and managers are miserable, no one gets listened to at all. This is reminiscent of working for the circus! Even our competitors tell us we have a reputation for being the most under appreciated adjusters in the country. The past 3 seminars I have attended had Bill Degrocco get up and just berate the hell out of everyone warning us he was watching our every move! And then you wonder why morale is so low? There is probably 2% of adjusters that are dishonest so why disrespect your entire staff. One of my fellow adjusters was in one of the small group break out classes that Tony Nicely (CEO) was in and when the ridiculous work load was brought up he got all kinds of pissed off and told the room that GEICO had adjusters that were able to get all there work done in a normal work day, that's GEICO's answer for everything, they always have someone that is ok with whatever is going on, never mind the other 90%!

Profit sharing.,"This company is too much into micromanaging. It seems as if they think that they have to put words into the mouths of their sales and service employees and any veering from those words is grounds for punishment in the form of non-A calls. They promise so many monitored calls a month but they never provide those many monitored calls, so if you get 2 non-A calls but only get 15 monitored calls then your dreaded stats for the month are higher than if they'd actually provided the 20 calls they promised. Next thing you know, you are in meetings with supervisors wanting to know why your stats for non-A calls are so bad.The percentage for raises in the last 6 or 7 years has been AWFUL. I don't understand why Warren Buffet talks the big game about wanting the wealthier to be taxed more because his secretary pays a higher percentage in taxes than he does, if he actually doesn't care about GEICO employees. He doesn't care about his employees and that is shown by the lousy raises being given each year as if that's all the employees really earned. With the amount of calls per day that the employees handle, and with the numbers of customers who are retained or added to GEICO's book of business, any business man who claims to care about the working class would know that he needs to treat his employees better. If he doesn't want to give better raises, then think about getting better training for management. They have the mentality of salt mine supervisors, always warning about the stats or threatening about what is going to happen if everyone doesn't get better and better, meaning faster and more robotic--while at the same time claiming to want those of us on the phones to be friendly with the customers. And we are! But sometimes customers just aren't happy with GEICO and they let GEICO know on the surveys.THOSE AWFUL SURVEYS!! GEICO send surveys to the email boxes of the customers after they've talked with one of us on the phone. They don't tell the customers that any negative feedback is going to hurt the one they just talked to at GEICO. So the caller was on the phone waiting for one of us to get free from a call so we can take care of him/her. They may have waited 20 minutes and on that survey that customer complains about that. Guess who gets dpunished? Yep, the employee who got that call--even though there was nothing the employee could do to lessen the wait time for the caller. HIRE more people, GEICO, or quit trying to blame the employees for something beyond their control!!!!!!! When the insurance rates go up, the customers complain on the surveys. When their teenager becomes licensed, the rates really go up and they really complain on the surveys. When some new agent gives the customer the wrong information, the next agent gets an earful and the customer fills up the survey with their dissatisfaction with having to call more than once to get a problem resolved. The pressure to sell, sell, sell, but only within a small window of time gets the customer upset because they want time to think it over and discuss it with other family members. So they only get a quote--a quick one that doesn't include all of the details about the drivers and the autos and the coverage. Then they call in to say they want the policy, but when the different agent gets all of the complete information, the quote doesn't apply any longer. Different amounts makes the customer upset. The customer takes it to the survey and next thing you know the second agent gets dinged on their stats for a bad survey. This is dishonest and unethical to blame the ones on the front lines for the problems caused by management--all the way to the top.",Current Employee ,,"In my 15 years at GEICO, I've come across 2 managers/supervisors that knew how to work with people.

If it weren't for that, I would count a year of my life as a complete waste of time.","They expect their sales people to sell an automobile insurance policy from beginning to end in 15 minutes, no matter how many vehicles, how many drivers, how many tickets and accidents, etc. If the customer's cell phone dies, you can't call them back--no matter if you're just ready to take the payment. When that happens, the person calls right back in and gets someone else who takes the payment. Or, if the person only has cash at that moment, they can't buy the policy until 30 minutes later when they make a deposit at the bank or buy a pre-paid card. THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME!They try to tell you that it happens equally to everyone, but that's not exactly a true statement. The random person who gets your customer's payment gets bumped up in queue preference, meaning that they are considered someone who has a higher-likelihood of making a sale because of that. Depending upon the timing of when someone comes out on the sales floor, say like if they're during income tax season when they start, a person can, by the luck of the draw, be rated as a better sales person. So, if you start taking real calls in late February, early March, you will probably have a higher close rate than someone who comes out a month later. This tells GEICO that you are a better sales person, and that gives you preference in the queue. You get paid more bonus, and you get promoted and raised.Now, onto the Q/A portion of your commission (incentive). Let's say you take 500 applications in a month's time, and of those applications you sell 300 policies. At $40/policy that's a pretty good bonus check, right? Not necessarily. You can sell policies like a champ, and make GEICO lots of money, but if you take longer than 899 seconds to do so, or if you asked the customer about college education but didn't specify associates/bachelor's/masters/PhD; if you put the wrong emphasis on the wrong word in a question; if the customer says something to you that you couldn't hear correctly and it would have affected the rate by one penny--you get a 0 on that call. Now, they ""randomly"" review X amount of calls per month, and if you don't get a high enough Quality score, you don't get paid on those 300 policies you sold. That means that, on a busy month, you take 500 calls and sell 300 policies, 3 phone calls that might not have been down to the word and comma exactly done 100% correct--that disqualifies you for getting paid. It puts you further down the list for raises and promotions, and it ensures that you either stay where you are (making GEICO lots of money but not being compensated for it), or you eventually just quit because you can't make any headway.This job is not for you if you can't stand the idea of sitting and saying the same words and phrases to hundreds of customers every month, doing so for years or decades, and not making enough money to pay your bills. If you can somehow plan it out so that you start taking calls around the first or second week February that count toward your performance reviews, and if you're a speed talker, and if you can use black magic to ensure that a customer's cell phone never dies and they always have enough money for the first payment available on a visa or master card that is not pre-paid (pre-paid cards don't qualify for the best payment plan), then I say go for it!",Former Employee ,"Macon, GA","Take AHT out of stats, allow call backs, and allow customers to be COD'd on policies if they don't have any form of payment other than cash.

The insurance license is paid for by GEICO. The overall benefit package of health and life insurance is good. Profit sharing is nice if you are hired early in the calendar year. Your immediate teammates are always willing to help you out (since they understand everyone is in the same boat). It's great they have onsite security staffing, most locations have onsite gyms and onsite cafeteria (no free meals-just convenience).

Instead of praise, encouragement and assistance from upper management for handling your case loads well, employees are met with retorts, criticism, and threats of replacement for any suggestions they may have made to upper management. It's sad to see how management gets rid of good employees by creating hostile work environments, nick-picking on employees they don't like to fire them or make them quit (when many others may get away with the same work progress/quality). It's been said by management that GEICO would rather have one employee do the work of four people instead of paying wages for three more employees (to create a less stressful work environment). Why? The line they feed to us is: it allows for more profit sharing. Sadly, the truth is it doesn't. Your profit sharing portion is tied to your salary, and they will work you to the bones for every penny they pay you. You will work overtime for no pay. You will work weekends for no pay. You will work other people's files for no pay. And, when they feel you are on the brink of having an emotional breakdown, mental breakdown, or a valid case against them for overworking you without pay they will fire you if you haven't quit already.Basically, you won't have time for yourself, your family and definitely not your friends. GEICO's hollow promises of promotions from within does not come with any good work ethics and hard work a person puts in. No one in upper management looks like a plain Joe-everyone looks like they stepped out of a GQ or Glamour magazine. It's always awkward talking to them since you don't know if they have been bashing you or one of your close colleagues (who may not be as good looking or fashionable), or if they are trying to leverage themselves into your bedroom.

Wonder this Company is successful...""",Great people outside of management.,"A word to the wise... the positive comments being posted on here are by employees of the company being paid to do so. And FYI to those individuals, I have already found new employment and am very happy with my new company. And yes, it is in the same industry.I came into this company thinking I want this to be the last company I work for. After a year of employment I knew this wasn't possibleI have 5 years experience in the insurance industry. After relocating to New York I looked into working at GEICO. When you go to an interview at GEICO you are herded through like cattle. If you make it through the first step of the process you are then granted an interview with a supervisor and then a manager. If you qualify they will hire you on the spot. Which can be a good thing but after further scrutiny the reason they hire the way they do is because of such high turnover (of the 16 people in training there are only 9 people left working there, they all left on their own accord).You then begin the training process which is 6 months long for each department. Well, training is about 8 weeks in each department but then you go to ""transition"". Transition is a glorified version of babysitting in which your ""coach"" watches every move you make and orders you to perform tasks like a drill sergeant.One of the huge problems with this company is some of their programs. This is the main reason I left the company. The Supervisor Leadership Program (SLP) puts individuals that are proven leaders (had decent grades in college) through all levels of claims within 2 years. They put these individuals with absolutely no claims experience in charge of individuals with 3 + years of claims experience to coach them to succeed. Which is difficult to understand when these individuals are already succeeding. They then proceed to give these individuals preferential treatment in regards to promotions up to and including management positions. Now you have individuals who have never performed the job that they are managing. For any individual who has ever worked in corporate America, this is the antithesis of what a successful company should do.I am very happy and completely satisfied with my career choice and the position in which I am now working.

In fact, without some of my co-workers there, I probably wouls not have been able to get through many of my days there. My co-workers were the only reason I kept my sanity there. Literally.","There's way too many to list, so I'll just list the most important ones so that you can really understand why I despised working for Geico so much:-Management plays favorites. No one will admit it, but they do. If your a favorite, management will turn a blind eye id you are doing unethical things to make your goals & you will get promoted quickly. (Case in point: a certain current TA1 supervisor in Woodbury was known for cheating to make his ARX goal as TCR1 examiner.) Oh, & if you're not a favorite & management takes a disliking to you (even if just because your personalities clash), watch out; your life will be made miserable so you will quit, unless they find a reason to fire you first. Which they will look for.-The pay sucks, the raises are virtually mon-existent, & Geico holds profit sharing over your head as it's actually a reasonable bonus. I get paid almost 70% more (& that's invluding my profit sharing payout) at my current job to do the same work (& there's A LOT less files you handle), plus get bonuses, reasonable raises, & a pension.-Unreasonble expectations are set & management does the bare minimum to ""help"" you meet them. But they will be quick to place you on a coaching or performance plan, which also has reasonable expectations laud out in it. Only this time it will be ""up until & including termination"" as your consequence.-""Up until & including."" You will hear that phrase over @ over again during your career at Geico. That's because they like to threaten you to get you to do your job. Geico doesn't believe in positive reinforcement. Unless you count be given yet another gecko trinket as a ""reward"".-Even though I listed some of my co-workers as a pro, others need to be listed as a con. For numerous reasons. Some are not that bright & many are lazy. And although I do believe a lot of people need to utilize FMLA to deal with health issues, most everyone on it abuses it. And there are a lot of people that blatantly abuse it, calling out sick 1, 2, & even 3 times a week (almost every week). There are so many people thar have ""anxiety"" & ""migraines"" it's ridiculous. FMLA doesn't have the nickname ""Friday Monday Leave"" at Geico for no reason.-Seniority isn't respected when it should be. You can be rated a 4.4, gave a grwat Geico resume, & been in your position forever. But good luck posting for another position, because your co-worker who has only been there 6 months but is rated a 4.6 just got the job over you.-The open door policy is a fake. Management uses any complaints you make against you instead of using your constructive criticism as an opportunity to improve things. And HR will always back up management, not you.I could go on & on w/ the cons, but I think you get my point.",Former Employee ,"Woodbury, NY","Geico's Upper Management wouldn't listen to any advice anyways, so I won't even waste my time.",Woodbury, NY

GEICO is a successful company, I'm sure you've seen the commercials on TV, heard them on the radio, and if you're reading reviews about it you'll probably start seeing ads pop up in your web browser. GEICO provides really good benefits to its associates, some of them were about as comparable for a civilian job to what I got in the military. The thing I always enjoyed was that the supervisors and management team were always willing to provide help and didn't make you feel like you were bothering them if you had a question. They also do quite a bit to acknowledge accomplishments both individually and as a team. Right as I left the company, the Dallas office did a massive shift realignment to ease some of the workload and make supervisors more available to their respective teams, which I'm sure has had good results.","I don't know if you can really consider this to be a con, but it's definitely something to keep in mind if you're considering working at GEICO: They have extremely high expectations of their associates. The job I did in CSR is a call center job and you are expected to be available at pretty much all times to answer incoming calls. They seem to have no understanding or tolerance of taking time between calls to finish up what you are working on. You are there to be a worker bee, and that is it. They are going to try to squeeze every ounce of work out of you that they can. Basically, efficiency matters above all else to them. Also, it is sometimes very difficult to get time off. Even if you try to plan 3 or 4 months out, it is sometimes impossible.

You are just a number to them, and if you are not constantly reaching your goals and exceeding them, then you hear about it constantly. Not to mention the goals are constantly changing, and none of the supervisors are on the same page. One supervisor will tell you one thing, and then you hear something else from a different supervisor. I don't know how they manage that place, because it is constant chaos. If you are selling good, they disregard any errors that you are making, but if you are not selling well enough to their standards, you are under a constant microscope and always warned about your job being on the line. I was warned 3-4 times in my first 4 months there that my job is on the line (and i was hitting almost all of my goals and was best in my training class). The supervision and coaching is really poor. As a brand new employee, my supervisor was never there for me. Then after 3 months, they switched my group and the new sup was even worse and had it out for me from day 1 because she had the best group on the floor and i was her worst employee (numbers-wise).

If you are looking for a company that comes with a built-in social network with tons of opportunities to volunteer and network, THIS JOB IS FOR YOU because they offer many opportunities to participate in local events, lots of ""GEICO Pride"" type days, and lots of fun contests, etc. for the employees.4. If you are good with following the rules/process, numbers-driven, and can adapt well or ""go with the flow"" and still expect results from yourself, THIS JOB IS FOR YOU because they love Six Sigma and your performance is based 100% on your monthly numbers - nothing more, nothing less.5. If you are competitive and seeing other people pass you up is a big motivator, THIS JOB IS FOR YOU because the sky's the limit with promotions, prizes, bonuses, and the like.6. If you love to research, question, and report your findings, THIS JOB IS FOR YOU because the claims process is exactly that: Research, Report, and Remunerate accordingly.7. If you do great in a team environment and love group work, THIS JOB IS FOR YOU because you are assigned to a team and sink or swim as a team.","Anything having to do with Customer Service, Claims, or Sales - RUN AWAY. Very professional environment can be offputting to some as it can lead to a culture of unapproachability.

It's the luck of the draw how easy or complicated the claim will be - each car accident is different. You are dealing with claimants, lawyers, doctors, police, the Department of Insurance, and Medicare, sometimes all in the same claim. There are a LOT of smokers at our office who didn't smoke before they got here. It's also hard to leave the job at work and they say to let it all roll off, but it's hard to shake off telling other people ""no"" all day, being told you're not doing enough even though you put in countless hours every week well beyond your normal work schedule, and I've heard the stress level has caused more destroyed marriages, relationships and friendships than any other place I've worked.""PASS IT UP"" CHECKLIST:1. If you cannot time-manage or multitask well, THIS JOB IS NOT FOR YOU because you get curveballs thrown at you from all angles, all day long.2. If you have a learning disability or other behavioral health diagnosis, THIS JOB IS NOT FOR YOU because the time management, punctuality, stress management, workload management, etc. expectations are extremely high. Diagnoses are a very real barrier, and this job doesn't account for them and there's no way to accommodate for them. It's the nature of the beast.3. If you have health problems that cause you to call out sick or take more than 1 day off PER MONTH, THIS JOB IS NOT FOR YOU because your attendance needs to remain at 97% and you WILL be marked down, regardless of the reasons. Even if it's a broken leg or a heart attack on the job (which are true stories).4. If you are invested in activities outside of work that are time-consuming, or for which you are REALLY passionate, THIS JOB IS NOT FOR YOU because you WILL work longer than your 7.75 hours at least 4 days per week. Be prepared to give up much of your social life to GEICO. That's probably why they offer so many opportunities to volunteer. They don't expect you to be best buddies with your teammates, but you end up getting to know them WELL because those are the ONLY people you will EVER SEE until you get promoted past Service or Claims.5. If you are a ""pushover"" type or wallflower, and that's just part of your DNA, and you can't or won't learn to toughen up, THIS JOB IS NOT FOR YOU because the ""ugly"" side of claims is being assertive, sometimes having to deny claims to really good people. Sometimes you'll deal with jerks, too. Workplace-wise, the environment is competitive and sometimes cutthroat. Adversely, you will encounter people with much less experience than you climbing the ladder faster because their numbers are good and they play the game well. You will find people who manipulate the system and throw others under the bus to make themselves look good.

Every other insurance company offers less stressful and higher paying work in the same industry.The performance goals start reasonably enough, but every time you exceed those goal, that is then made the standard. If you continue to do well, the standard continues to increase until the best you can do is average or slightly under, which they then use to justify giving you the bare minimum raise, or worse---no raise at all.Their idea of promoting within is to give someone a lateral ""promotion"" wherein they are doing the jobs of their supervisors for the same pay they were getting before, then they ""rotate"" you back into your original position occassionally, essentially to show you that the job you were doing was a privilege to be granted and removed by the company. After years of doing this, if you're lucky, you get granted a promotion, and in most cases get a marginal pay increase for your troubles.The sole goal of this company is growth, not the care of their policyholders or their employees. In order to advance in any meaningful way you have to take classes like ""Getting Results Through People"" where they specifically train you on how to manipulate your underlings into not feeling too good about their performance so you can justify holding off raises. There's also a class called ""Winning Attitudes"" for the underlings to essentially tell them all ""keep your mouth shut and your head down, and if you have a problem with that we offer four free telephone emotional counseling sessions to help you with that"".

There was alot of phone monitoring in sales and claims. Sales complained about every little bitty dot but the Manager in claims was good about bragging on you for a job well done. The call volume was always so high and there were always calls waiting so associates in other depts had to quit their job and take these claim calls. It is almost impossible to take calls all day and work the files on your desk in the claims dept. Some of the Supv'sare extremely mean and hard to work for. Mgt is always asking associates to make a list of ways to improve things in your dept but it seems they never do any of these things so why ask, instead mgt just changes things and makes things worse. Mgt acted like they were so much better than an associate. Some of the Mgrs would not even look at you much less speak to you. Mgt certainly needs to clean house.

There is no time to investigate a claim correctly as there are not enough adjusters to handle all the claims.

I worked in subrogation and I was an arbitrator which I loved but it was so unreasonable at the files I got that were not worked and it was impossible to win in Arb. Also, Mgt did not think that Subro was a very important dept. Mgt did not want to have a Manager in Subro that would take up for our dept so they got rid of a very good Manager and started putting a string of different Managers who would come and go. Mgt treated Subro like we were a step child and I heard that right from the mouth of a Supv.

I work long and hard, usually work on my breaks and lunch to keep up with my diary (work that needs to be done on the claims assigned to myself), but because my numbers are too high, I'm stuck in CSR - there is no value placed on the fact that while I may take a little longer to handle a claim, when I'm finished, it is well and truly handled. :) We are ridiculously micro-managed, and the numbers they expect us to hit (and like others have pointed out before, these goals change often, but usually not in any realistic or helpful way) are almost impossible to get to and maintain without something lacking, and, often, that's in the way claims are handled. Somewhat efficiently, but way too fast. I've been with the department a long time (too long!) and cannot tell you how many times I come across claims that haven't been handled correctly, and the most likely culprit is the fact that we are graded on the amount of time it takes to handle our claims - I'd like to know if that's how Tony Nicely, Warren Buffett or George Rogers would want their own personal auto claims handled. When you know your job may be on the line if you don't move quickly (which I have a huge problem with personally, being a fairly responsible and somewhat anal individual :} ), the claim -and ultimately the customers- will suffer.And don't even get me started on ARX - Auto Repair Express. Our 'concierge claims service' similiar to what Progressive hawks - you drop off your damaged vehicle at a repair shop near you, leaving it with the GEICO auto damage adjuster, often getting a rental car, the repairs are done there, and then GEICO guarantees the work while you own the car. A nice idea, that works out really well, but I find it unbelieveably unfair that we are graded not on just offering this service, but whether it's accepted and used, or not! I am not a salesperson - I wasn't hired to do sales, I was hired to handle claims. I have only limited control over whether someone chooses to use this service, and it infuriates me that whether someone wants to pocket the check or use the body shop they've used for decades or their family owns a collision center, even if I offer it and do my very best to sell it - whether the customer declines ARX and/or doesn't ultimately leave their car at the ARX repair facility - helps determine whether I will get a raise, or maybe even keep my job or not!

And while ARX is a good idea, it's not fair to base our goals on someone else's choices - I can accept being rated on whether I offer it and really try to sell it every time, but I ultimately I cannot control whether a customer will accept and use the program - do you all HONESTLY bring your BMW's and Mercedes and all the other high-end cars you own to our ARX shops or to the dealership?

You can/should get paid way more for what you know and the amount of work you're doing. They take someone who knows nothing about insurance and trains them to know everything, then.... pays you minimally for their knowledge.Respect- The respect you get is based off of how robotic and submissive you are (At least in regards to the Service, Sales & Claims positions). The truth is if you don't perform at the top level then you don't deserve respect according to the way your treated at Geico. Sadly everyone in the department is not going to fall into that category, therefore will be made to feel unworthy and undeserving of respect until they improve. Nothing is stated to this effect, obviously, yet it's most certainly an unspoken truth.Job Security- Job security in itself is a meaningless word being that you're never truly secure at a job unless you own the business, let's be real. That being said if there ever were a job that you could feel secure at then Geico surely is 100% definitely NOT it. They will tell you that you don't have to worry about ever being laid off because they are a strong stable company and blah blah blah... That's not the problem at all. Let me just throw a little numbers out there for you. I started off in a training group that had 10 new hires in it including myself. Out of those only 3 are still with the company (1 is my friend and he is leaving just hasn't found an alternative yet) Out of the employees no longer with the company only 1 quit, the rest were fired. Think about that statistically.... They have a ""job fair"" every Wednesday to find new employees? why would you need so many new employees if you're such a great company with so much ""job security""? Your growth rate is good but i assure you it's not that good. It's actually quite amusing to see so many people believe this is an upstanding company to work for... tsk tsk tsk.Work/Life balance- I'm not even going to elaborate on this topic but let's just say since at least 60% of the employees at Geico are fearful they will ""be next"" (fired) then Geico tends to linger on their mind throughout their day a bit even after they leave. If you are in management (and i know because i have friends that are) then your workload extends way beyond reasonable hours worked and like all employers they put you on salary so no matter how much time you spend at work your paycheck remains the same. Lastly they drill the company in your head sort of like a parent would drill making good grades into their child. moving on....career potential/growth- If you are a Drone/Peon then you might have a chance of moving up but only if you have or are pursuing a degree. Although even then it is so political that unless you have the ""majority vote"" then you're not going anywhere.Needless to say i was FIRED for what they referred to as ""system manipulation"". Without going in to detail I'll briefly explain. When waiting to take a call or are on a call you're ""available"" in order to stop calls from coming in whether it be to document a policy or ask a question they tell you to use what is referred to as ""call work"". Since Geico is so immensely micro-managed, when you are on call work your supervisor can see and will tell you to hurry up or get off of it, and its very use affects your grade(which I'll explain in more detail later). I found that if i dial an interdepartmental number (one that will just take me to prompts and unless i pick an option no one will answer) then i can document my policies in peace. Not aware that this was an ""integrity issue"" i started doing it beginning end of March till the middle of April. Granted we are not taught to do this but believe me if you work in the atmosphere that Geico provides you will empathize with my need to put a temporary rest to the micro-management, a vacation if-you-will. I stopped doing it in April because that's when i got fired.

Benefits are much better than anywhere else in the area. Benefits include a Vanguard 401k, multiple options for health and dental coverages, various types of life/accidental death insurance offered, tuition reimbursement and of course, the GEICO employee's favorite, profit sharing. Although the rest of the country is in a serious slump, GEICO employees were given profit sharing this year for last year's performance. GEICO is a strong and continually growing company with strong job security in an otherwise shaky market.

GEICO thinks that just because someone has a degree, they are somehow more intelligent or will be more adept at their job, regardless of how little their degree relates to business at all. it is also now more difficult to get approval for tuition reimbursement at private schools (i.e. strayer university).the ""emerging leaders"" program has really got to go. the head of the program has a serious entitlement problem. every other employee at geico, especially supervisors, in the departments that they are rotated through, are resentful that a fresh out of college ""kid"" with no experience was magically chosen to be placed directly in a management position after being rotated through a few departments. many of these ""emerging leaders"" leave the company once they are finished with their rotations anyway. i dont know of a single one who actually stayed with the company once they were finished with their rotations.",Current Employee ,"Fredericksburg, VA",Claims Home Office needs to lighten up about the small useless check boxes and radio buttons that are required to pass a file audit.,Fredericksburg, VA

2/19/09,2,Management,"""I remember when I was proud to work at GEICO.""","The compensation is good, with profit-sharing being a great benefit. Overall health benefits are very good. Upper management is very sharp, thorough and has a clear vision. I also met some of the best and finest people I have ever met while working at GEICO. Sales is always a very upbeat, happy place, but the atmosphere in both service and claims is oppressive.","When I started at GEICO in 1999, the company was very people-oriented. By 2003, the number-crunchers reigned and everything was about metrics and little was about customer satisfaction or representing the company in a positive way.Middle management has a mixture of people, but overall the talent pool is a large drop-off from upper management. With middle management it seems to be more about personal gain and recognition than teamwork. Middle management expects to receive loyalty from supervisors and associates but does not know how to give it back. Most importantly there is a disconnect between upper management and middle management. When upper management speaks to lower management and associates the themes that are stressed are different than what middle management passes down.Job stress is huge for people in the phone units because of metrics. The people who care about GEICO's customers want to help them, but metrics (telephone statistics such as Average Handling Time, Hold Time, etc.) forces them to get the customer off of the line too soon. Consequently, the people whom you really want helping the customer and who complete the tasks properly are punished because their metrics are poor. This leaves goal-obsessed, non-caring individuals on the phone giving customer experiences that leave a lot to be desired.The ""A"" Call is a never-ending change of requirements as controlling number crunchers try to convert what will always be an subjective task into a measurable ""objective"" rating. Based on Six Sigma, GEICO's adaptation of the ""A"" Call tries to put customer service in a manufacturing framework. This may work for cookie cutter phone calls, but for exceptions and unusual circumstances it does not work well. That may sound acceptable, but how many auto accidents are alike? For that matter how many customers are alike?Having been in planning challenge sessions many times, I have a lot of respect for Tony Nicely and his management team. My respect for middle management is very low, with a few very positive exceptions.I can only speak for Macon, but too many people are related, and nepotism - plus who you attend church with - plays a real role in promotions and opportunities. GEICO is also politically correct to an extreme. Don't say anything that could be interpreted as improper or could be misunderstood in a negative way or you will find yourself explaining what you ""really meant"" was different than what someone else reported to management. I've seen it happen too often.GEICO needs to do the following:1 - Admit when you mistakenly promote people above their competence levels and place them in a lesser position . It's OK to be wrong sometimes. Just admit it and fix the problem so their subordinates can succeed.2 - Understand that the ""A"" Call is subjective because not every customer is the same and a checklist is not the way to deliver quality. Spend some cash and install a survey system to contact customers immediately after the call and do follow-up. If the customer is completely happy, the information given to the insured is 100% accurate and timely; and, all documentation is accurate and complete, then give the agent an ""A"" Call. Does it really matter if the agent mentions geico.com?3 - Reward good customer service.4 - Understand your business plans and execute them! If Tony Nicely knew how many mid-level managers faked at least part of their business plan and never had intentions of completing some action plans he would have a cow.5 - Add eyecare to your healthcare plans. Come on, your people spend 7.75 hours per day looking at computer screens.6 - Use metrics as a training tool instead of a club to beat your employees.7 - Find a way to fix the nepotism problem in Macon, and . . . guess what? If someone's spouse or aunt or brother or mother or grandfather is a director or a VP, then it really doesn't matter if they are in another department or profit center because in Macon everyone knows who is who.8 - Numbers may be a perfect way of measuring a thing, but make sure you are measuring the things that are important. Too often you measure an imperfect proxy and get imperfect results through faulty interpretation. In other words, number crunchers are useful but keep your focus on your customers satisfaction.I left GEICO to pursue better and less stressful work, but many friends are still there and no one says, ""I love it!"" When I think of how it was in the beginning, I miss it.

2/19/09,3,Claims Service Representative,"""Overall, not a bad place to be""","A good reason to work for Geico is job security.

Between the management that is always willing to help, the job security, tuition reimbursement and overall being provided tools to succeed, I can't think of a reason why anyone would not want to work for this company.Geico has a detailed hiring process to make sure that they are hiring people who are fit to do the job, not just bodies to occupy seats. Where most companies first rule is that the customer is always right, Geico's first policy is to provide emloyees with the opportunity to succeed. The training is great and prepares you for as much as possible prior to dealing with customers. It's also great how you are eased into the position and not just thrust into the line of fire. Geico makes an investment with each employee it hires. As a company, they don't expect you to walk in the door ready to go. They pay for you to get your license. As an employee, I have had nothing but support since the first day that I walked in the door. The supervisors are great. They provide feedback and support at all times. Nobody is expected to know everything. There is always someone that can help you find an answer to any questions that you may have. At Geico, I have never been spoken down to or punished for bad performance. Instead we recieve positive coaching to help improve any mistakes we may make.Another great reason to work for Geico is job security. Being owned by Warren Buffet and backed by Berkshire Hathaway, you can rest assured that even in these difficult times, your job is secure as long as you are perfoming up to standards with the company. There are always opportunities to make more money with Geico as well. Employees who are reaching their performance goals can apply for higher positions within the company as soon as six months after hire. Also, being an employee, you get the first look for promotion opportunities over new employees walking in the door.Another reason to work for Geico is the tuition reimbursement program. Most companies offer a percentage for tuition reimbursement. Geico provides 100% tuition reimbursement for a limited number of classes per semester, and the limit is only because they don't want your school to interfere with your work or vice versa. This includes online classes for your freshman and sophomore year.Finally, to me, Geico is a fun place to work. There are contests and rewards for those who perform at a high level. Insurance is a tough industry to work in. You provide a product that a person can not physically hold and touch. There are two main goals at Geico; bring in new customers, and keep them here with outstanding service. I take pride in providing outstanding service on a daily basis. I loved this company as a customer, and I love it ten times more as an employee.",The only downside to working for Geico is the distance that I have to drive to get there.,Current Employee ,"Lakeland, FL",Keep up the good work.

However GEICO offers very competitive salaries and has a really good profit sharing plan for all associates at all levels. There is a very good sense of job security, which comes at a price of getting accustomed to some traditional managing methods (not as much flexibility of work hours in all departments, but some are flexible). The management hierarchy is flat (which also means management overhead is low). But GEICO does rely on individuals to take ownership and perform at their best. Most associates have been in their positions for a very long time and are experts at what they do. GEICO also actively hires from outside and also does college recruiting. So fresh ideas are also coming in. In general, I have found GEICO associates to be at the top of their game, yet very down to earth. Normally you have to deal with a lot of egos in order work with that talent level.

How are you supposed to retain them when they can get insurance for hundreds of dollars cheaper with someone else without taking Defensive Driving?

Don't listen to those who say they love the company, unless you too have a low judgement bar, because you're really not compensated compared to other companies, and every time you bring it up they throw profit sharing in your face when it's not even a definite that you will get it.The people who make decisions for at least my specific job have NO idea what they are talking about. Most of the processes are fairly new, and most of the supervisors and management that make these decisions either never have done the job, or it's been so long since they've done it, they can't relate to the stress of the employees. How crazy is that? Would you want someone to be a supervisor of a Cooking staff if they've never cooked? It's ridiculous.When I started, GEICO was an ""Employee first"" company, however, it's no longer the case. I would say the 75% of the supervisors I have worked under have a God complex and feel that they do no wrong and have all the answers. They even show favoritism and hold grudges against their employees. Now the other 25% of the supervisors that I've had were completely wonderful and I would work again for them in a heartbeat.The customer service stick that they constantly beat their adjusters with. Let me say this...Adjusters have a bad stigma attached to them already. Our job is to regulate the cost of losses as much as possible. Although we do it fairly, the general public doesn't see it that way. If you are doing your job correctly, it will be very hard for you to get the 90+% satisfaction rating that they want. I've even had my supervisor suggest that we should beg the customers to rate us all ""10"" on the survey if we if it comes down to it.And the smoking gun: the amount of work that they require you to do is ridiculous. If you manage to have the 8 appts in the ARX program that they call for, in some cases even 5 appts, you either A) have to work through lunch to get all of them handled within the business day that they require, or B) Skip lunch and work OT, but get this...you don't get true OT.
