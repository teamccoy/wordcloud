There’s tons of information all over the internet. I wanted to explore what employees were saying about the company I work for. Glassdoor has a lot of information that I wanted to explore. 

 

What are employees saying?

What are the good and bad things about the company?

Are there one or two things that really jump out to look into?

 

Now, I’ve worked at this company for some time and I’m pretty well versed on the company culture and work environment. Therefore, I wanted to see is everyone else thinking the same thing? 

 

The best part of this project is that you can repeat the process with multiple companies. Say for example you are comparing your company with its competitors or you’re on the hunt for a new job. I want to get a quick pulse on the company and know what I’m walking into or what questions to ask for deeper understanding. 

 

This project uses :

Python (Beautiful Soup, WordCloud, Python Image, Matplotlib, Requests, Numpy and Pandas)    

 

Overall: Used Python to web scrape the comments fromGlassdoor, clean the data, process the comments through a NLP wordcloud filter, and display the image in Matplotlib.
